<body lang="ko-KR" link="#000080" vlink="#800000" dir="ltr"><pre class="cjk"><font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">I'm really looking forward to this lecture, not like I wasn't looking forward to the other ones,<br/>
<br/>
but the stories that I want to cover tonight, one of the things that just absolutely staggers me about them,<br/>
<br/>
especially the story of Cain and Abel (which I hope to get to) is, like, it's so short. It's unbelievable.<br/>
<br/>
It's like ten, eleven lines.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing to it at all.<br/>
<br/>
And I've found that it's essentially inexhaustible in its capacity to reveal meaning, and I don't exactly know what to make of that.<br/>
<br/>
I mean I...<br/>
<br/>
I think, you know, because I said I was going to take as<br/>
<br/>
rational an approach to this issue as I possibly could, I think it has something to do with<br/>
<br/>
this intense process of condensation across very long periods of time. That's the simplest explanation.<br/>
<br/>
But I'll tell you, the information in there is so densely packed that it really is--<br/>
<br/>
it's really-- it's not that easy to come up with an explanation for that. Not one that I find fully compelling.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I do think that the really old stories (and we've been covering the really archaic stories in the Bible so far)<br/>
<br/>
I think that one of the things that you can be virtually certain about is that everything about them<br/>
<br/>
that was memorable was remembered, right, and so in some sense<br/>
<br/>
And this is kind of like the idea of Richard Dawkins idea of memes, which is often why I thought that Richard Dawkins<br/>
<br/>
if he was a little bit more<br/>
<br/>
mystically inclined he would have become Karl Jung, because their theories are unbelievably similar. The similar of meme and the similar of arch...<br/>
<br/>
the idea of archetypes of the collective unconscious are very, very similar ideas except Jungian ideas-- far more profound in my<br/>
<br/>
estimation well it just is he thought it [through] so much better. You know<br/>
<br/>
Because Dawkins tended to think of memes sort of like a mind worm you know something that would infest a mind and maybe multiple minds<br/>
<br/>
But he never really took I don't think he really ever took the idea with the seriousness it deserved<br/>
<br/>
And I did hear him actually make a joke with Sam Harris the last time they talked about the fact that that<br/>
<br/>
there was some possibility that the<br/>
<br/>
Production of memes say religious memes could alter evolutionary history, [and] they both avoided that topic instantly<br/>
<br/>
They had a big laugh about it men decided they weren't going to go down that road<br/>
<br/>
and so that wasn't fair that was quite [interesting] to me, but<br/>
<br/>
these<br/>
<br/>
Is the the the density of these stories I do really [think] still is a is a mystery it<br/>
<br/>
Certainly has something to do with their absolute<br/>
<br/>
[their] in their impossibility to be forgotten [you] know and that's actually something that we could be tested empirically<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if anybody has ever done that because you could tell<br/>
<br/>
naive people two stories even equal length right one that had an archetypal theme and the other that didn't and then wait three months and<br/>
<br/>
See which one's people remembered better and be relatively straightforward thing to test<br/>
<br/>
I haven't tested it, but maybe I will at [some] point, but anyways, that's all to say that. I'm very<br/>
<br/>
Excited about this lecture because I get an opportunity to go over the story of Adam and eve and the story of cain and Abel<br/>
<br/>
And I [hopefully] [manage] both of those today, and maybe we'll get to the story of Noah and the tower of babel as well<br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn't count on it not arthur eight we've been not at the rate we've been progressing if that's okay<br/>
<br/>
That's that's no problem. It's there's no sense rushing this [alright]. So we're going to go before we go that before we do that<br/>
<br/>
I want to<br/>
<br/>
Finish my discussion of the idea of the psychological significance of the idea of God, and I've been thinking [about] this a lot more<br/>
<br/>
You know because of course this lecture series gives me the opportunity and the necessity to continue to think and you know it<br/>
<br/>
Certainly is the [case] so the hypothesis that I've been developing with the trinitarian idea is something like<br/>
<br/>
That the trinitarian idea is the earliest<br/>
<br/>
Emergence in image of the idea that there has to be an underlying cognitive<br/>
<br/>
Structure that gives rise to consciousness as well as consciousness itself and so what I would suggest<br/>
<br/>
Was that the idea of God the father is something akin to the idea of the a priori?<br/>
<br/>
structure that that gives rise to consciousness<br/>
<br/>
You know that's an inbuilt part of us, so that's our structure. You could think about that as something<br/>
<br/>
That's been produced over a vast evolutionary time span<br/>
<br/>
and I don't think that's completely out of keeping with the with the<br/>
<br/>
With the ideas [that] are laid forth in Genesis one at least if you think about them from a metaphorical perspective<br/>
<br/>
And it's hard to read them literally because I don't know what you know. There's an emphasis on day and night, but<br/>
<br/>
The idea of Day and night as as 24-hour diurnal. You know<br/>
<br/>
daytime and nighttime<br/>
<br/>
Interchanges [that] are based on the claw on the earthly clock seems to be a bit<br/>
<br/>
Absurd when you first start to think about the construction of the cosmos so just doesn't seem to me that a literal interpretation<br/>
<br/>
is<br/>
<br/>
Appropriate and I mean it's another thing that you might not know but you know many of the early church [fathers] one of them origen<br/>
<br/>
in particular stated very clearly this was in 300 ad that these ancient stories were to be taken as as<br/>
<br/>
Wise metaphors and not to be taken literally like the idea that the people who established<br/>
<br/>
Christianity for example were all the sorts of people who were biblical [literalist]. It's just absolutely historically wrong<br/>
<br/>
[I] mean some of them were and some of them still are that's not the point<br/>
<br/>
Many of them weren't and it's not like people who live 2,000 years ago were stupid by any stretch of the imagination<br/>
<br/>
And so they were perfectly capable of understanding what constant you know what constituted something approximating a metaphor and also knew that<br/>
<br/>
fiction in some sense<br/>
<br/>
Considered as an abstraction could tell you truth that nonfiction wasn't able<br/>
<br/>
Wasn't able to get at lets you think that fiction is only for entertainment<br/>
<br/>
And I think that's a very that's a that's a big mistake to think that so<br/>
<br/>
Alright, so here we go<br/>
<br/>
so yes<br/>
<br/>
so with regards to the idea of God the father, so the idea is that<br/>
<br/>
In order to make sense out of the world you have [to] have an a priori cognitive<br/>
<br/>
Structure that was something that immanuel kant as I said last time<br/>
<br/>
put forward as an argument against the idea that all of the information that we<br/>
<br/>
Acquire during our lifetime [is] a consequence of incoming sense data and the reason that kant objected to that and he was<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely right about this is that you can't make sense of sense Data without an a priori structure<br/>
<br/>
You can't extract from sense data the structure that enables you to make sense of sense data<br/>
<br/>
It's not possible, and that's really being demonstrated<br/>
<br/>
I would say Beyond the shadow of a doubt since the 1960s and the best<br/>
<br/>
demonstration of that was actually the initial failure of artificial intelligence<br/>
<br/>
because when the AI people started promising that we would have fully functional and autonomous robots and artificial intelligence back in the<br/>
<br/>
1960s<br/>
<br/>
What they didn't understand and what stole them terribly until about the early 1990s was that it was almost<br/>
<br/>
That the problem of perception with a much deeper problem than anybody ever<br/>
<br/>
Recognized because like when you look at the world you just see well look there's objects out there and by the way you don't<br/>
<br/>
Objects you see tools just so you know in the neurobiology. That's quite clear<br/>
<br/>
You don't see objects and infer utility<br/>
<br/>
You see useful things and infer object so it's actually the reverse of what people generally think but the point is is that<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of whether you see objects or useful things when you look [at] the world you just see it<br/>
<br/>
And you think well seeing is easy because they're the things are and all you have to do is like you know turn your head<br/>
<br/>
And they appear<br/>
<br/>
And that's just so wrong that it's it's almost impossible to overstate<br/>
<br/>
Like the problem of perception is staggeringly difficult and one of the primary reasons that we still don't really have autonomous robots<br/>
<br/>
so there were a lot closer to it than we were in the<br/>
<br/>
1960s because it turned out that you actually have to [have] an embodied you have to have a body before you can say it and<br/>
<br/>
Even more importantly you [have] to have a body before you can see<br/>
<br/>
Because the act of seeing is actually the act of mapping the patterns of the world [onto] the patterns of the body. It's not<br/>
<br/>
Things are out there you see them then you think about them, then you evaluate them<br/>
<br/>
Then you decide to act on them and then you act. [I] mean that you could call that a folk idea of<br/>
<br/>
Psychological processing or a perception it's not that is not how it works like your eyes for [example] map<br/>
<br/>
One of the things they do is map right onto your spinal cord for example<br/>
<br/>
They might right onto your emotional system<br/>
<br/>
So it's actually possible for example<br/>
<br/>
For people to be blind and still be able to detect facial expressions<br/>
<br/>
Which is to say you can with someone who's cortically blind so they've had their visual Cortex<br/>
<br/>
Destroyed often by a stroke they'll tell you that they can't see anything<br/>
<br/>
But they can guess which hand you put up if you ask them to and if you flash them pictures of Angry or Fearful<br/>
<br/>
Faces they show skin conductance responses to the more emotion laden faces<br/>
<br/>
And it's because imagine that the world is made out of patterns which it is then imagine that those patterns are transmitted to you<br/>
<br/>
Electromagnetically you have to light and then imagine that the pattern is duplicated on the retina<br/>
<br/>
And then that pattern is propagated along the optic nerve and then the pattern is distributed throughout your brain and some of that pattern<br/>
<br/>
Makes up what you call conscious vision, but other parts of it<br/>
<br/>
Just activate your body so for example when I look</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">at this when I look at this this<br/>
<br/>
whatever it whatever it is a<br/>
<br/>
Bottle that's words, huh?<br/>
<br/>
You know when I look at it<br/>
<br/>
Especially with intent in mind as soon as I look at it the pattern of the bod of the bottle<br/>
<br/>
activates the gripping mechanism of my hand and<br/>
<br/>
Part of the action of per Sortie the active perception is to adjust<br/>
<br/>
My bodily posture including my hand grip to be of the optimal size to pick that up<br/>
<br/>
And it's not that I see the bottle and then think about how to move my hand<br/>
<br/>
That's too slow<br/>
<br/>
It's that I use my motor motor Cortex to perceive the bottle and that's actually somewhat<br/>
<br/>
Independent of actually seeing the bottle as a conscious experience<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, huh the reason the reason that I'm telling you that [all] of that<br/>
<br/>
And there's much more about that that can be told<br/>
<br/>
Rodney Brooks ['is] someone to know about he's a robotics engineer who worked in the 1990s and he invented the Roomba<br/>
<br/>
among many other things so he's a real genius stuffed guy and<br/>
<br/>
He works was one of the first people to really<br/>
<br/>
Point out that<br/>
<br/>
to have to be [able] to have a<br/>
<br/>
machine that<br/>
<br/>
Perceived well enough to work in the world<br/>
<br/>
That you had to give it a body and that the perception would actually be built from the body up rather than from the abstract<br/>
<br/>
cognitive perceptions down and so<br/>
<br/>
well<br/>
<br/>
and that that turned out to be the case and bird rooks boiled all sorts of weird little machines in the<br/>
<br/>
1990s that didn't even really have any central brain but they could do things like run away from [light] and<br/>
<br/>
so they could perceive light that their perception was that act of running away from right and<br/>
<br/>
So perception perception is very very very tightly tied to action in ways that people don't normally perceive<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, that's all to say that you cannot perceive the [world] without being embody and you know your embodied in a manner<br/>
<br/>
that's taken you roughly three and a half billion years to pull off right there's being a lot of death as a<br/>
<br/>
Prerequisite to the embodied form that you take and so it's taken all that trial and error to produce something like you that can interact<br/>
<br/>
with the complexity of the world well enough to last the relatively paltry 80 or so years that you can last and<br/>
<br/>
So I think about that as this may be wrong, but I think it's a useful at least it's a useful<br/>
<br/>
Hypothesis, I think the idea<br/>
<br/>
God the father is something like the birth of the idea that there has to be an internal<br/>
<br/>
Structure that out of which consciousness itself arises that gives form to things and well<br/>
<br/>
And if that's the case and perhaps it's not but if it's the case it's certainly reflection. It's a reflection of the kind of<br/>
<br/>
Factual truth that I've been describing now<br/>
<br/>
and then like I also mentioned that I kind of see the idea of<br/>
<br/>
Both the holy Spirit and those also of christ and most specifically of christ in in the form of the word<br/>
<br/>
as<br/>
<br/>
the active consciousness that that structure produces and uses not only to to<br/>
<br/>
Formulate the world because we formulate the world at least the world that we experience<br/>
<br/>
We formulate but also to change and modify that world because there's absolutely no doubt that we do that<br/>
<br/>
Partly with our bodies which are optimally?<br/>
<br/>
Developed to do that. Which is why we have hands unlike dolphins would have you know very large brains like us<br/>
<br/>
But can't really change the world. We're really<br/>
<br/>
adapted and evolved to change the world and to world and our speech [is] really a an<br/>
<br/>
Extension of our ability to use our hands, so the speech systems that we use are you know very [well-developed] motor?<br/>
<br/>
very well-developed motor skill and<br/>
<br/>
generally speaking your your dominant linguistic hemisphere is the same as your dominant hand and<br/>
<br/>
People talk with their hands like [me] as you may have noticed [and] we use sign language<br/>
<br/>
and there's a tight relationship [between] the use of the hand and the use of language, and that's partly because<br/>
<br/>
language is a<br/>
<br/>
productive Force and the hand is part of it part of what changes the world and so all those things are tied together in a<br/>
<br/>
Very very complex way with this a priori structure and also with the embodied structure<br/>
<br/>
And I also think that's part of the reason why classical christianity puts such an emphasis not only on the divinity of the spirit<br/>
<br/>
But also on the divinity of the body, this is a harder thing to<br/>
<br/>
grapple with you know it's easier [for] people to think if you think in religious terms at all that you have some sort of<br/>
<br/>
Transcended spirit that somehow detached from the body that might have some life after death [something] like that<br/>
<br/>
but the Christian Christianity in particular really insists on the divinity of the body, so the idea is that<br/>
<br/>
There's an underlying structure. It's this quasi patriarchal nature partly because it's for complex reasons<br/>
<br/>
But partly because it's a reflection of the social structure as well as other things and then that<br/>
<br/>
uses consciousness in the form particularly of language<br/>
<br/>
But most particularly in the form of truthful language in order to produce the world in a manner<br/>
<br/>
That's good, and I think that's a walloping<br/>
<br/>
Powerful Powerful idea especially the relationship between the idea that it's truthful speech that gives rise to the good because that's a really fundamental<br/>
<br/>
Moral Claim and I think that's a tough one to beat man because one of the things I've really noticed is and then this and<br/>
<br/>
It isn't just me that's for sure is that you know there's a lot of tragedy in [life]<br/>
<br/>
There's no doubt about that and lots of people that I see for example in my clinical practice are<br/>
<br/>
Laid Low by the Tragedy of life<br/>
<br/>
But I also see very very frequently that people get tangled up in deceit in webs of deceit that are often multiple<br/>
<br/>
Generations long and that just takes them out you know and so that so deceit can produce<br/>
<br/>
Extraordinary levels of suffering that lasts for very very long periods of time and that's really a clinical truism. You know because<br/>
<br/>
freud of course identified one of the<br/>
<br/>
Problems that contributed [to] the suffering we might associate with mental illness with repression<br/>
<br/>
Which is it's kind of like a lie of omission<br/>
<br/>
That's a perfectly reasonable way to think about it<br/>
<br/>
and Jung stated straight out that there was no difference between the psychotherapeutic the curative psychotherapeutic effort and<br/>
<br/>
Supreme moral effort including truth that those were the same thing as far as he was [concerned] and carl Rogers another great<br/>
<br/>
Clinician who was at one point a Christian missionary before he became<br/>
<br/>
More [moore's] more strictly scientific. He believed that it was in truthful, dialogue that that that<br/>
<br/>
clinical transformation took place and you know it and of course one of the<br/>
<br/>
prerequisites for genuine transformation in the clinical setting is that the<br/>
<br/>
Therapist tells the truth and the client tells the truth because otherwise how in the world. Do [you] know what's going on?<br/>
<br/>
how can you solve the problem when you don't even know what the problem is and [you] don't know what the problem is unless the<br/>
<br/>
Person tells you the truth that's something really to think about in light [of] your own<br/>
<br/>
Relationships because you know if you don't tell the people around you the truth?<br/>
<br/>
And they don't know who you are and maybe that's a good thing<br/>
<br/>
You know because well seriously people have reasons to Lie, right?<br/>
<br/>
I mean that aren't trivial<br/>
<br/>
But it's really worth knowing that<br/>
<br/>
you can't even get your hands on the problem unless you formulate it truthfully and if you can't get your hands on the problem the<br/>
<br/>
Probability that you're going to solve it is it's just so low and so then I've been thinking [about] as well<br/>
<br/>
The this and this idea has become more<br/>
<br/>
Credible to [me] the longer. I've developed it the longer. I thought about it. You know the idea that there's oh<br/>
<br/>
Go Bob<br/>
<br/>
It's partly the idea that<br/>
<br/>
Well, let me let [me] figure out how to start this property friend of mine business partner and a guy that [I've] written scientific papers<br/>
<br/>
with very smart guy<br/>
<br/>
Took me to task and I think I told you this a little bit about<br/>
<br/>
Using the term dominance Hierarchy which might be fine for like<br/>
<br/>
Chimpanzees and for lobsters and for creatures like that<br/>
<br/>
But not not first not not for chimpanzees even so much and and he said something [very] interesting<br/>
<br/>
he thought that the [idea] of dominance Hierarchy was actually a projection of a<br/>
<br/>
early 20th century quasi Marxist<br/>
<br/>
Hypothesis [onto] the animal Kingdom that was being observed and the notion that the hierarchical structure that you see that<br/>
<br/>
characterizes say mating hierarchies in Chimps for<br/>
<br/>
Example the idea that that was predicated on power was actually a projection of a kind of political ideology<br/>
<br/>
and I thought that really bugged me for a long time when he said that because<br/>
<br/>
Like because I'd really been used to using the term dominant iurc and I thought he told me all that<br/>
<br/>
I thought that's so annoying<br/>
<br/>
It's so annoying because it might be right and then it took me months to think about it<br/>
<br/>
And then I and then I was also reading Frans de Waal at the same time [and] he's a primatologist and also Jaak panksepp<br/>
<br/>
Because he was a Brilliant Brilliant<br/>
<br/>
effective neuroscientist who unfortunately just died he wrote a great book called Affect of Neuroscience and<br/>
<br/>
For rats to play they have to play fair or they won't play with each other<br/>
<br/>
And that's that's a staggering discovery right because anything that helps<br/>
<br/>
Instantiate the<br/>
<br/>
Emergence of ethical behavior in animals and that associates it with an evolutionary<br/>
<br/>
Process which is essentially what what pays up was doing gives credence to the [notion] that the ethics that guide us are not near<br/>
<br/>
social<br/>
<br/>
logical<br/>
<br/>
epiphenomena Constructs [their] deep<br/>
<br/>
Deeply rooted if flat and that they're rats for god's sake he can't trust them and they still play fair you [know] and De Waal<br/>
<br/>
Notice that the chimp troops that he studied, but it wasn't wasn't the barber barbaric chimp that ruled with an iron</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">fist<br/>
<br/>
that was the successful ruler because he kept getting torn to shreds by his by the<br/>
<br/>
Compatriots that he ignored and stomped on Susie showed some weakness. They just tear him into pieces the chimp leaders that were<br/>
<br/>
Stable you know that had a stable [kingdom]. Let's say<br/>
<br/>
We're very<br/>
<br/>
Reciprocal in terms of their interactions with their friends and chimps have friends and they out they actually last for very long time chimp friendships<br/>
<br/>
and they were also very<br/>
<br/>
reciprocal in their interactions with the females and with the infants<br/>
<br/>
And I thought that's [what] Frans De Waal is a very smart guy<br/>
<br/>
And I thought that was also foundational science because it's really something to note that<br/>
<br/>
The attributes that give rise [to] dominance in a male [dominance] Hierarchy sort of use [that] word let's call it<br/>
<br/>
Authority that might be better or even shudder competence which [I] think is a better way of thinking about it<br/>
<br/>
Is that that's not predicated purely on anything? That's that's that's as simple as brute power, and I think [too]<br/>
<br/>
You know I think as well that the idea and this is [a] deeply devious and dangerous<br/>
<br/>
political idea in my estimation the idea that male dominance hierarchies sorry Male hierarchies are<br/>
<br/>
Fundamentally predicated on power in a little in a [law-abiding] in a law-abiding society<br/>
<br/>
I think is I think all you [fu] think about that for like a month say<br/>
<br/>
She's not long to understand<br/>
<br/>
How absurd [that] is because most people who are in positions of authority let's say are just as hemmed in by ethical<br/>
<br/>
responsibilities or even more so than people at the other levels of the of the hierarchy<br/>
<br/>
And we know this even in the managerial literature because we know generally speaking that<br/>
<br/>
Managers are more stressed by their subordinates than the subordinates are stressed by their managers<br/>
<br/>
And that's not surprising you want to be responsible for like [200] people you really want that. That's hard work, man<br/>
<br/>
and I mean [I] know it's a pain to have a boss because the<br/>
<br/>
To care about what the boss thinks and maybe the person is arbitrary which case they're not going to be particularly successful<br/>
<br/>
But it's no joke to be responsible for 200 people<br/>
<br/>
and you have to behave very carefully when you're in a position of<br/>
<br/>
Responsibility and authority like that because you will get called out if you make mistakes<br/>
<br/>
[constantly] so it's not like you're it's not like because you have a position<br/>
<br/>
That's higher up in the hierarchy that you're less constrained by ethical necessity now if you're a psychopath<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's a whole different story<br/>
<br/>
but<br/>
<br/>
psychopaths have to move pretty rapidly from Hierarchy to hierarchy right because they get found out quite quickly and<br/>
<br/>
As soon as their reputation is shattered then they can't get away with their Shenanigans anymore, so [okay]<br/>
<br/>
[so] all of this is to say that there is something very interesting about<br/>
<br/>
the Pattern of Behavior [so] imagine that<br/>
<br/>
Imagine that sexual selection is working something like this<br/>
<br/>
And we know that sexual selection is a very very very very powerful biological<br/>
<br/>
Force even though biologists ignored it for almost a hundred years after charles Darwin originally wrote about it thinking mostly about natural selection<br/>
<br/>
They didn't like the idea of sexual selection because it tended to introduce the notion of mind<br/>
<br/>
Into the process of [evolution] because it deals with choice<br/>
<br/>
you know<br/>
<br/>
But so imagine on the one hand that you have a male hierarchy<br/>
<br/>
We know that the men at the top of the Hierarchy are much more likely to be?<br/>
<br/>
Reprimanded the boil. It's particularly true of men<br/>
<br/>
So you have twice as many female ancestors as you have male ancestors not going to do the math?<br/>
<br/>
But and I know it doesn't sound plausible, but you could look it up and figure it out<br/>
<br/>
It's it's perfectly reasonable fact that actually happens to be true<br/>
<br/>
So there's twice as if twice as many female ancestors because females are twice as likely on average to leave<br/>
<br/>
offspring as men now, what happens is<br/>
<br/>
Any man man who does reproduce tends to reproduce more than once but a bunch of the reproduce zero?<br/>
<br/>
Whereas so it would be the average man who reproduces has two children [and]<br/>
<br/>
the average man who doesn't reproduce have zero obviously and the average woman who reproduces has one child so<br/>
<br/>
That means that there's twice as many<br/>
<br/>
Females in your line as there is males so that that's a big deal and and so imagine that it works something like this<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
<br/>
the men elect<br/>
<br/>
the<br/>
<br/>
Competent men who are admired and who are and who are I?<br/>
<br/>
Can't say dominant who are who are given positions of authority and respect let's put it that way and it's like an election<br/>
<br/>
Now it could be an actual democratic election, but it's at least an election of consensus or it's at least an election of well<br/>
<br/>
We're not going to kill him for now. Which is also a form of election, right?<br/>
<br/>
it's a form of tolerance [you] know so<br/>
<br/>
So and then what happens is the women for their part peel from the top of the mental Hierarchy and so you've got two<br/>
<br/>
Factors that are driving<br/>
<br/>
human sexual selection across vast stretches of evolutionary time<br/>
<br/>
One is the election of men by men to positions where they're much more [likely] to reproduce<br/>
<br/>
And the second is the tendency of women to peel off the top of [d</span></font>á<font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">il] dominant turkeys which is extraordinarily well established [cross] culturally?<br/>
<br/>
even if you flatten out, the<br/>
<br/>
socio-economic<br/>
<br/>
Disparity say between men [and] women like they've [done] in scAndinavia. You don't you don't?<br/>
<br/>
Reduce the tendency of women to peel off the top [of] the male hierarchy by much<br/>
<br/>
And why would you [I] mean women are smart why in the world wouldn't they go for four?<br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn't they strive to make relationships with men who [are] relatively successful?<br/>
<br/>
And why wouldn't they let the men themselves define why that how that constitutes success?<br/>
<br/>
it makes sense like if you want to figure out who the best man is why not let the men compete and the<br/>
<br/>
Man who wins whatever the competition is is the best man by definition? [how] else would you define it, so<br/>
<br/>
okay, so why am I telling you [all] that well the reason is is because<br/>
<br/>
it seems to me that there's this comp this being this complex interplay across human evolution between<br/>
<br/>
the election of the male dominance Hierarchy and sexual success<br/>
<br/>
And that's a big deal if it's true. It could be because what would happen [you] see is that as men evolved<br/>
<br/>
they would evolve to be better and better at climbing up the male hierarchy because the ones who weren't good at that wouldn't reproduce so<br/>
<br/>
Obviously that's going to happen<br/>
<br/>
But then it wouldn't [just] be a hierarchy because there's a whole bunch of different hierarchies and so then you might say well are there<br/>
<br/>
commonalities across hierarchies<br/>
<br/>
reasonable thing to propose it mean<br/>
<br/>
They're not completely opposed to one another at least if you're more success relatively more successful in [Run]<br/>
<br/>
Hierarchy then you're more probable<br/>
<br/>
It's more probable that you'll be successful in another<br/>
<br/>
And that's actually a really good definition of general<br/>
<br/>
Intelligence or IQ and that's actually one of the things that women select men for now men also select women for that<br/>
<br/>
But the selection pressure is even higher from women to men and general Iq is one of the things that propels you up across?<br/>
<br/>
Dominant turkeys because it's a general problem-solving mechanism, and the other thing [that] seems to do that to some degree is conscientiousness<br/>
<br/>
And there's also some evidence that women prefer<br/>
<br/>
conscientious men so and of course why wouldn't they because you can trust them and and<br/>
<br/>
And and and they work, and so those are both good things<br/>
<br/>
So then you think okay, so men have adapted to start to climb the male dominance Hierarchy<br/>
<br/>
but it's the set of all possible hierarchies that they're adapted to climb and<br/>
<br/>
So then you think there's there's a set of attributes that can be acted out<br/>
<br/>
That and that can be embodied that will increase the probability that you're going to rise to the top of any given<br/>
<br/>
Hierarchy and then you could say well that as you adapt to that fact then you start to develop an understanding of what that pattern<br/>
<br/>
Constitutes and so that starts to become the abstract<br/>
<br/>
representation of something like multi-dimensional competence<br/>
<br/>
And that's like the abstraction of virtue itself well and none of that has them none of that's arbitrary now<br/>
<br/>
and that's as bloody well grounded in biology if anything could [be] and I think [that's] a really hard argument to refute and<br/>
<br/>
Like one of the things I should tell you [about] how I think is [that] when I think something<br/>
<br/>
I spend a long time trying to figure [out] if it's wrong<br/>
<br/>
You know because [I] like to hack at it from every possible Direction<br/>
<br/>
To see if it's a weak idea because if it's a weak idea<br/>
<br/>
Then I'd rather just dispense with it and find something better<br/>
<br/>
And I've had a real hard time trying to figure out what's wrong with that idea<br/>
<br/>
I it seems to me that it's pretty damn solid and then the idea that<br/>
<br/>
You know if you watch what people do in movies, and so on and when they're reading fiction<br/>
<br/>
It's obvious that they're very good at identifying both the hero and the antihero we could say the antihero<br/>
<br/>
generally speaking the bad guy is someone who strives for<br/>
<br/>
Authority and position, but fails<br/>
<br/>
generally speaking not always, but fail<br/>
<br/>
so he's a good bad example a kid you take a kid to a<br/>
<br/>
good guy bad guy movie the kid takes out pretty fast that he's not supposed to be the bad guy and and<br/>
<br/>
Figures out very quickly to zero in on the good guy<br/>
<br/>
And that means that there's there's an affinity between the pattern of good guy that's being played out in the fiction and the perceptual<br/>
<br/>
Capacity of the child you [know] and one of the things I told my son when he was a kid I used to take him<br/>
<br/>
to movies that were sometimes more frightening than they should have been but<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I always told him</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">was I never said don't be [afraid] because I think that's bad advice for kids<br/>
<br/>
What I said was keep your eye on the hero<br/>
<br/>
Right keep your [eye] on the hero and again<br/>
<br/>
He was gripped by the movie and often quite afraid of them you know because movies can be very frightening<br/>
<br/>
so he just like zero in on that guy and<br/>
<br/>
Hoping and you know what it's like in [a] movie you hope that the good guy wins<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, and I mean why do you do that?<br/>
<br/>
Where does that where does that come from you see how deeply rooted that is inside you you'll bloody well go<br/>
<br/>
Line up and pay to watch that happen<br/>
<br/>
it's not an easy thing to understand and it's it's so self-evident to people that we don't even notice that it's a tremendous mystery and<br/>
<br/>
So is it so unreasonable to [think] that we would have actually over the Millennia come to some sort of collective<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion about what the best of the best guys are best of the good guys are and what the worst of the bad guys are<br/>
<br/>
And to me archetypically  speaking thinking of that as the Hostile brothers<br/>
<br/>
So that's christ and Satan or cain and Abel for example very common mythological motif the hostile brothers<br/>
<br/>
It's like those are those those are archetypes<br/>
<br/>
it's like the satan for example is by definition the worst that a person can be and<br/>
<br/>
Christ by definition, this is<br/>
<br/>
Independent of anything but<br/>
<br/>
Conceptualization is by definition the best today that a man can be<br/>
<br/>
now<br/>
<br/>
as I said speaking psychologically and conceptually but I<br/>
<br/>
given our capacity for imagination and our ability to engage in fiction and our love for fiction and our<br/>
<br/>
capacity to dramatize and our love for the story stories of heroism and<br/>
<br/>
Catastrophe and and good and evil. [I] can't see how it [could] any other way like so [well]<br/>
<br/>
so so that's part of the<br/>
<br/>
Idea that's driving the notion of the evolution of the idea of God and even more specifically<br/>
<br/>
Driving the evolution of the idea at least in part of the trinity so God is an abstracted ideal<br/>
<br/>
formulated in large part to<br/>
<br/>
Dissociate the ideal from any particular incarnation or man [or] any ruler and there's another rule in the biblical stories<br/>
<br/>
which is that when the actual ruler [I've] mentioned this before when the actual Ruler becomes confused with the<br/>
<br/>
Abstracted ideals then the state immediately turns into a tyranny and the whole bloody thing collapses, [so] [the] idea, it's so sophisticated<br/>
<br/>
You know one of the things that we figured out and this was a hard thing to figure out was that<br/>
<br/>
you had to take the<br/>
<br/>
Abstraction and divorce it from any particular power structure and then think about it as something [that] existed as an abstraction<br/>
<br/>
But a real thing right real and that [it] governed your behavior in [everyone's] behavior including the damned King<br/>
<br/>
The King was responsible to the abstracted ideal man that's an impossible. That is such an impossible ideal<br/>
<br/>
You know why would if they agreed [that] [5000] years ago?<br/>
<br/>
But one of the things you see continually happening in the old testament [is] that as soon as the israelite for example the ISraelite Kings?<br/>
<br/>
become<br/>
<br/>
almighty<br/>
<br/>
the real God comes along [and] just<br/>
<br/>
Cuts them into pieces and then the whole bloody state falls apart for like hundreds of years. It's like<br/>
<br/>
I think that's a lesson that that we have not thoroughly<br/>
<br/>
Consciously yet learned. It's still implicit in the narratives. We still haven't figured out. Why that's the case<br/>
<br/>
Again, I think that's a real hard argument to to to dispense with<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
<br/>
All right, so we looked at this a little bit<br/>
<br/>
The trinitarian idea is that there's a there's a father<br/>
<br/>
that's maybe the<br/>
<br/>
Dramatic representation of the structures that underlie consciousness the embody structures that underlie consciousness, and then there's the son<br/>
<br/>
And that's that that's consciousness<br/>
<br/>
But in its particular historical form that's the thing that's so interesting about the figure of the son<br/>
<br/>
And then there's consciousness as such and that seems to [be] something like the the indwelling spirit and so<br/>
<br/>
I mean these psychological ideas came from somewhere right that they have a history they didn't just spring out of nowhere<br/>
<br/>
and they emerge from from dreams and<br/>
<br/>
Hypothesis and artistic visions and all of that over a long time and maybe they get clarified into something like consciousness<br/>
<br/>
but it takes a long time to get from<br/>
<br/>
To get from watching you know from to chimpanzees watching each other to a human being saying well<br/>
<br/>
We're we all we all exhibit this faculty called consciousness. I mean, that's a long journey<br/>
<br/>
You know that's a really long [journey], and there's going to be plenty of stages in between<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I really like about Jean piaget the developmental psychologist was that he was so insistent that<br/>
<br/>
children Act out and dramatized ideas before they understand them and<br/>
<br/>
And Merlin Donald who's a psychologist at Queen's university?<br/>
<br/>
wrote a couple of interesting books along those lines at all as well looking at the importance of<br/>
<br/>
imitation for the development of Higher cognition in human beings and so the notion that<br/>
<br/>
We embody ideas before we abstract them out and then represent them in an articulated way<br/>
<br/>
I think is an extraordinarily solid idea<br/>
<br/>
And I really can't see how it could [be] any other way<br/>
<br/>
And if you watch children you see that like think about what a child is doing<br/>
<br/>
When he plays house or she plays house you know the child acts out the father or the mother<br/>
<br/>
But what's so interesting about me to think well? Look isn't that cute she's imitating her mother<br/>
<br/>
It's like no<br/>
<br/>
She's not that's not what happens because when your child imitates you it's very annoying because you move your arm<br/>
<br/>
And then they move their arm, and you know that you move your head to copy you no one likes that<br/>
<br/>
It's direct direct imitation. That's not what a child is doing with the child is playing what the child is doing is watching the mother<br/>
<br/>
over multiple<br/>
<br/>
instantiations and then extracting out the spirit called mother and<br/>
<br/>
that's whatever if mother like across all those multiple manifestations and then laying out that pattern internally and<br/>
<br/>
Manifesting itself in an abstract world, it's so sophisticated<br/>
<br/>
It's just I'm that's what you're doing when you're playing house or having a tea partier or taking care of a doll<br/>
<br/>
It's not you've seen your mother take care of a doll. You haven't seen that<br/>
<br/>
It's that you're smart enough to pull out the abstraction<br/>
<br/>
And then embody it and certainly the child is attempting to strive towards an ideal at that point<br/>
<br/>
You know she's not lighting her doll on fire. You know well with you know certain exceptions, but generally<br/>
<br/>
ones that we try to not encourage right, so<br/>
<br/>
So you see that capacity in the children, and it's something we also know that if children<br/>
<br/>
Don't don't engage in that sort of dramatic and pretend play to a tremendous degree<br/>
<br/>
That they don't they [don't] get properly socialized. It's really a critical element of<br/>
<br/>
Developing self understanding and then also [developing] the capability [of] being with others because what you do when you're a child<br/>
<br/>
Especially around the age of four is you jointly construct a shared fictional world?<br/>
<br/>
Will play house together let's say and then you act out<br/>
<br/>
your joint [roles] within that shared fictional world you know and and that's a form of<br/>
<br/>
Very advanced cognitions very sophisticated [I] see that and piaget did as well and so did you and so did freud these brilliant?<br/>
<br/>
Observers and also Merlin Donald these brilliant observers of the manner in which cognition came to be they noted very clearly that<br/>
<br/>
embodied imitation and dramatic abstraction<br/>
<br/>
constituted the ground out of which higher abstract cognition emerged enough, how could it not [be] because<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, we were mostly bodies before we were minds<br/>
<br/>
Clearly and so we were acting out things way before we understood them just like the chimpanzees act out the idea that<br/>
<br/>
You know you have to act reasonably sensibly if your head chimpanzee or you're going to get yourself ripped apart<br/>
<br/>
And you see that rules because when wolves have a dominance dispute, you know<br/>
<br/>
They pump up their hair at each other to look big and they they growl and bark and you know they're very menacing and one<br/>
<br/>
Wolf chickens out rolls over puts up his neck and basically what he's saying is yeah, I'm pretty useless<br/>
<br/>
So you could kill me [if] I want to if you want to and the other wolf says yeah<br/>
<br/>
You know you're pretty useless and I could tear out your throat but tomorrow we might need to bring down a wolf or moves<br/>
<br/>
so I'll kick you out and<br/>
<br/>
And it's not like they think that<br/>
<br/>
because they don't know they don't think [that] they acted out as a behavioral pattern then if you're an [anthropologist] or [a]<br/>
<br/>
An ethologist and you went and watched the wolves you'd say it's as if they were acting according to the following rule and that<br/>
<br/>
Often confused me because I thought well the wolves act black wolves act out rules, and I thought no. No a rule is what we<br/>
<br/>
Construct, when we articulate a behavioral pattern right we observe a stable behavioral Pattern and when we articulate it<br/>
<br/>
We can call it a rule but for the wolves. It's not a rule<br/>
<br/>
It's just a stable behavioral Pattern and so we acted like wolf troops or chimpanzee troops all of that<br/>
<br/>
When well I'm firfer untold really [untold] tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of years before we were able to formulate<br/>
<br/>
That pattern of behavior at anything<br/>
<br/>
approximating a story or the image and [and] even longer before we could articulate it as a set of<br/>
<br/>
Ethical Rules, and I'm dwelling this I know I've repeated some of this before<br/>
<br/>
But it's so important because you know there's this tremendous push, especially from the social the social<br/>
<br/>
Constructionist to make the case that ethics is arbitrary ethics is morality is relative<br/>
<br/>
There's no fundamental biological grounding in relationship to human behavior<br/>
<br/>
Especially [in] the in the category of ethics, and</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">I think that that's well first of all<br/>
<br/>
It's dangerous because that means that people are<br/>
<br/>
Anything you want to turn them into [and] you bloody well better be careful of [people] who think [that] and second?<br/>
<br/>
I just think that the evidence that that's wrong is so overwhelming that we should just stop thinking that way<br/>
<br/>
I mean the and that's probably why I'm also attacking this from an evolutionary perspective<br/>
<br/>
there's lots of converging lines of evidence that ethic ethical standards of<br/>
<br/>
at least of the most of the most crucial store Sort not only evolve but also<br/>
<br/>
Spontaneously re-emerge for example in the dramatic play of children, so we need to take that seriously and so well<br/>
<br/>
That's partly what we're doing here<br/>
<br/>
trying to take that seriously, so<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so the idea there at least in part was [that] the father employed the sun to generate habitable order out of Chaos [I]?<br/>
<br/>
Also think there might be something more approximately true about that as well too because one of the things we do know<br/>
<br/>
There's something that's cool about men<br/>
<br/>
men are much more criminal than women and that by the way that does not look like it's<br/>
<br/>
Socio-cultural partly because it peaks when testosterone kicks in around 14 like it just spikes the hell up<br/>
<br/>
And then it really it stays pretty high until about 27 and so standard<br/>
<br/>
Penological theory for those of you who don't know this is that if you have a repeat offender?<br/>
<br/>
You know a guy who just won't stop getting in trouble<br/>
<br/>
[yes] home in prison till he's 28, and it isn't like you're rehabilitating him or anything. It's like by 28<br/>
<br/>
He's done with his criminal career because the crime curve is peaks at 15 and then falls down around<br/>
<br/>
27 or so it burns out<br/>
<br/>
and that's often by the way that's often that's that's often when men get married and settle down and [stabilized] one of the things that's<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that's cool about that is the creativity curve for men is almost exactly the same thing [it]<br/>
<br/>
Ramps up when testosterone kicks in and then it starts to flatten out around 27 that<br/>
<br/>
Curves Match very very closely so that's so that's that's quite cool<br/>
<br/>
It's the creativity<br/>
<br/>
Element of it that I'm particularly interested in because the creativity is in many ways it [attributed] youth and that's look. I mean<br/>
<br/>
if you look at that sentence<br/>
<br/>
And you've stripped it of its religious context<br/>
<br/>
what you would say is that well the older people use the younger people to<br/>
<br/>
Generate creative ideas and renew [the] world it's like yeah, that's that's what happens, and you you know you also have no idea<br/>
<br/>
How many of the things that we?<br/>
<br/>
Discovered or invented as human beings were stumbled across by children and adolescence<br/>
<br/>
You know because they're well, they're much more exploratory<br/>
<br/>
They're less constrained by their by their already extent knowledge structures<br/>
<br/>
and they're less conservative so yeah that seems just right to me, so<br/>
<br/>
And right in an extraordinarily important way<br/>
<br/>
Because it also means that it's like if you're an actual father<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that it means is [that] that's part of what you should be encouraging your son to do right<br/>
<br/>
Which is which [is] does the rail of a father is to encourage<br/>
<br/>
That is clearly the role and to encourage is to say well. Go out there confront the Chaos of<br/>
<br/>
The unknown and the Chaos that underlies everything and drop it with it. You know how because you can do<br/>
<br/>
It here as big as the Chaos itself<br/>
<br/>
And you know do something useful as a consequence and makes your life [better] and make everyone else's life better<br/>
<br/>
And you know you can do it and man. That's the right thing to tell that's the right thing to tell young men<br/>
<br/>
You know talking to young women is more complicated because they have more more<br/>
<br/>
Let's say issues to deal with because their lives are more complicated in some ways<br/>
<br/>
but that's definitely the right thing to be to be telling your your son and<br/>
<br/>
one of the things that I've really noticed<br/>
<br/>
recently since I've been lecturing especially in the last seven or eight months most of my audiences being young men and and<br/>
<br/>
I've talked a lot of them [too] a lot<br/>
<br/>
I've talked a lot to them about both truth and responsibility<br/>
<br/>
and I think that those those are the two things that underlie this capacity and<br/>
<br/>
It there seems to me to be a tremendous [hunger] for that idea. It's not the same idea as right<br/>
<br/>
You know it's very different ideas. It's a counterpart to right and so it's you know<br/>
<br/>
Life is [hard]. [it's] chaotic. It's difficult. It's really<br/>
<br/>
Definitely a challenge<br/>
<br/>
And so you can either shrink from that and no bloody wonder because you know it's going to kill you<br/>
<br/>
It's not it's no joke man where you can?<br/>
<br/>
Fuckin front it and try to do something about it<br/>
<br/>
Well, what's better and and then you say [to] the person look man?<br/>
<br/>
you could do it like that's what a human being is like and if you just stood up and got yourself together and<br/>
<br/>
You find out by trying that you can in fact do that<br/>
<br/>
And I do think that that's that's a great core religious message as far as I [can] tell and I think that's deeply embedded<br/>
<br/>
in this sort of in this sort of idea, so<br/>
<br/>
All right, so this is what I've [been] telling you. This is something like how knowledge itself is generated<br/>
<br/>
first of all there's the unknown as<br/>
<br/>
And that's really what you don't know anything about and generally when you encounter that you don't encounter it with thought<br/>
<br/>
You encounter it like this<br/>
<br/>
Right and that that's the first<br/>
<br/>
Representation of the absolutely unknown, it's something that is beyond your comprehension, and it's terrifying and because it's Beyond your comprehension<br/>
<br/>
You cannot perceive it you cannot understand it<br/>
<br/>
But you still have to deal with it and the way you deal with it<br/>
<br/>
Is [that] you freeze that's what the that's what a basilisk does say to the to the kids in Harry Potter, right?<br/>
<br/>
They take a look at it<br/>
<br/>
And they freeze<br/>
<br/>
that's the snake the<br/>
<br/>
Terrible snake of Chaos that lives underneath everything you see that that thing freezes you and that's because [you're] a prey animal<br/>
<br/>
but at the same time it makes you curious, and so that's the first level of<br/>
<br/>
contact with the absolute unknown is the<br/>
<br/>
Emotional combination of freezing and curiosity and that's reflected<br/>
<br/>
I think in the dragon stories the dragon is the terrible thing that lives underground<br/>
<br/>
Accords gold or hoards Virgins very very strange behavior for reptile as we pointed out before<br/>
<br/>
but the idea [is] that it's a symbolic representation of the<br/>
<br/>
Predatory quality of the Unknown combined with the<br/>
<br/>
capacity of the Unknown to generate nothing but novel information<br/>
<br/>
And it's very you can see that is very [characteristic] of human beings because we are prey animals, but we're also unbelievably<br/>
<br/>
Exploratory and we're pretty damn good predators<br/>
<br/>
And we occupy this weird cognitive niche and so one of the things we've learned is that if we?<br/>
<br/>
Forth Lightly confront the unknown terrifying as it is there's a massive prize to be gained<br/>
<br/>
continually and so that seems to be<br/>
<br/>
true, right<br/>
<br/>
[it's] true as anything is and then I would also say that that idea and we know that one of the metaphors that underlies [gods]<br/>
<br/>
extraction of<br/>
<br/>
Habitable order out of Chaos at the beginning of time is an older idea and a more archaic idea that God<br/>
<br/>
confronted something like the<br/>
<br/>
leviathan and that's one of the words for this serpent like Chaos creature that's often used in the old testament or the<br/>
<br/>
Leviathan and they<br/>
<br/>
Beat them on. Yeah. That's the other thing and so there's this [idea] that<br/>
<br/>
I think came probably came from the mesopotamia that the God either in the [sun-like]<br/>
<br/>
Aspect or in the father like aspect is the thing that confronts this terrible beast that?<br/>
<br/>
represents the Chaotic unknown and<br/>
<br/>
Cuts it into pieces and then sometimes gives the body parts to the populace in order to feed them so you can see a hunting<br/>
<br/>
Metaphor there as well, but it's deeper than that and so<br/>
<br/>
all right, so<br/>
<br/>
The first thing is there's the absolute unknown and the unknown is what you do not understand. It's what's beyond the campfire<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's what's beyond the tree even more anciently [an] old [word] when we when we lived in trees<br/>
<br/>
It's out there that where you don't know and what's out there<br/>
<br/>
Crocodiles and snakes and birds of prey and cats and all sorts of things like predatory cats<br/>
<br/>
And they will eat you but there's utility and going out there to find out<br/>
<br/>
What's there like maybe you go?<br/>
<br/>
And you don't kill the snake you kill the damn nest of snakes and that makes you pretty popular just as you should be that<br/>
<br/>
accelerates your your rep reductive<br/>
<br/>
Potential let's say and we're descended from people who did that and so we have this?<br/>
<br/>
Notion about how the world is structured that's deeply embedded in our pSyChe [like] really really deeply way way down way below<br/>
<br/>
the surface<br/>
<br/>
Cognition way down in the limbic system in these ancient parts of the brain that are like<br/>
<br/>
60 million years old or a hundred million years old or older than that?<br/>
<br/>
ancient ancient brain structures<br/>
<br/>
And so the first thing we do is we act out our<br/>
<br/>
Encounter with the unknown world and we act that out in the same way in a manner. That's analogous to the Manner<br/>
<br/>
That's presented as a description of what it is that God does at the beginning of time to extract habitable order out of Chaos?<br/>
<br/>
And [I] I will tell you about the other part of that for now, so you act it out first and then<br/>
<br/>
The second thing is you watch people who act it out?<br/>
<br/>
And you start to make representations of that that's stories, right?<br/>
<br/>
And maybe you admire them and then after a long time you collect a bunch of those stories<br/>
<br/>
and then you can say what that is you can articulate it as a pattern and<br/>
<br/>
So and this is something Nietzsche also figured out to begin with you know because prior [to] Nietzsche<br/>
<br/>
[I] would say he did so many things first it was quite remarkable. You know there was an idea that<br/>
<br/>
You first think and then you act, and then people</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">like to think that of course you do it<br/>
<br/>
Bloody Rubbish because you're impulsive as you can possibly imagine you're always doing things before you think and sometimes<br/>
<br/>
That's a really good idea so the idea that you see things and then think and then act<br/>
<br/>
It's like you really know I'm sorry did I don't do that. I know one<br/>
<br/>
I know I know does that and they certainly do that<br/>
<br/>
Don't do that when they're emotional you know you act first and one of the things that Nietzsche said very clearly was that our<br/>
<br/>
Ideas emerged out of the ground of our action over over thousands and thousands of years and then when philosophers were<br/>
<br/>
Putting forward those ideas what they were doing wasn't generating creative ideas<br/>
<br/>
They were just telling the story of humanity<br/>
<br/>
It's already there. It's already in us it's already in our patterns of behavior and and it strikes me that that's<br/>
<br/>
Well he was a genius and that was one of the genius one of his<br/>
<br/>
Many many observations of pure genius and so you can think about it. You know you can think about it like this, [too] is that?<br/>
<br/>
There's unknown and then you act in the face [of] the unknown and then you you dream about the action<br/>
<br/>
and that's what you're doing in a movie theater, and then you speak about it and<br/>
<br/>
So you know and of course once you speak about it that affects how you dream and how you dream affects<br/>
<br/>
How you act it's not like the all of the causal direction is it was one way because it's not deep these things loop<br/>
<br/>
But it's still from the unknown through the body through the imagination into articulation<br/>
<br/>
That's the primary mode of the generation of of wisdom let's say and you can easily map that onto an evolutionary explanation<br/>
<br/>
Because the body comes first right and then is the imagination, which is the body in<br/>
<br/>
Abstraction and only then the word and of course that's [exactly] how things did evolve because we could imagine things<br/>
<br/>
Long before we could speak at least that's the theory, so<br/>
<br/>
and I represented that this is a<br/>
<br/>
image from my book maps of meaning and so<br/>
<br/>
So the idea is that this is the fundamental representation of the unknown as such it's half<br/>
<br/>
spirit because it partakes of the air like a bird and it's half matter because it's on the ground like a like a like a<br/>
<br/>
Make and and that's what you think is there when you don't know what is there?<br/>
<br/>
That's how your body reacts to what's there when you don't know what is there? You know that [too] because if you're alone at night<br/>
<br/>
You know it maybe you're a little rattled up for one reason other maybe you watched a horror movie and you know there's some weird<br/>
<br/>
Noise in the other room. It's dark, and you could just try this once<br/>
<br/>
It's like so you're on edge you think<br/>
<br/>
You want to turn the light on and go in the room and see don't do that<br/>
<br/>
just open the door a little bit and sneak your hand in and just watch what your<br/>
<br/>
imagination<br/>
<br/>
Fills that room with right and then then you remember what it's like to be three years old in bed in afraid of the dark<br/>
<br/>
Right and I read a good book on dragons lately<br/>
<br/>
Recently that that that had a very interesting hypothesis about them. I thought one of the things the guy did was track<br/>
<br/>
I can't remember his name unfortunately<br/>
<br/>
Track how common the image of the dragon was worldwide. It's unbelievably widespread<br/>
<br/>
it's crazily widespread and he thought that this was actually the category of<br/>
<br/>
Primate Predator and<br/>
<br/>
The Predator was so predator is a weird category right because like there's there's crocodiles in it, and there's lions<br/>
<br/>
And they don't have much in [common] except they eat you so it's a functional category<br/>
<br/>
And so this is the this is the imagistic representation of the functional category of Predator and his predator<br/>
<br/>
Theory was well if you're a monkey, then a bird would pick you off like an eagle, and so that's this<br/>
<br/>
right and<br/>
<br/>
Then if it wasn't eagle it was a cat as they climb teary trees and give you a good chomping and then if it wasn't<br/>
<br/>
a cat<br/>
<br/>
And you go down to the ground and a snake would get you or maybe a snake would climb up the tree because snakes like?<br/>
<br/>
to do that and get you and so that's a<br/>
<br/>
pre cat<br/>
<br/>
snake<br/>
<br/>
basically<br/>
<br/>
Free cat snake bird, and that's the thing you really<br/>
<br/>
That's the thing [you're] really want to avoid you don't want to come across one of those and so<br/>
<br/>
[and] then you know the other thing it does is breathe fire<br/>
<br/>
Which is quite [interested] [because] obviously fire was both greatest friend and greatest enemy of humanity<br/>
<br/>
And we've mastered fire for a long time it might be as long as [two] or [three] million years<br/>
<br/>
That's what Richard rang him. [I] think it's [rang] [ham]. He wrote a book recently on. I think it was ragan<br/>
<br/>
who wrote a book on when human beings [learned] to cook that was about two million years ago and cooking increased the<br/>
<br/>
Increase the availability of calories you know how chimpanzees are sort of shaped like a big<br/>
<br/>
Like they're ugly. They're shaped like a big bowling ball<br/>
<br/>
You know they're really they look really fat, [and] it's and they're short<br/>
<br/>
and they're wide and that's because they have intestinal tracts that are like you know 300 miles long and the reason for that is because<br/>
<br/>
they have to digest leaves and so you go out in the forest and like sit there and eat leaves for a whole day and<br/>
<br/>
See how that works out for you. You know yeah, they have no calories in them. So chimps spend about [inkless] I<br/>
<br/>
think it's eight hours a day chewing and<br/>
<br/>
It's because what they eat has no nutritional value<br/>
<br/>
And then they have to have this tremendous<br/>
<br/>
Guts in order to extract anything at all out of it human beings at some point<br/>
<br/>
Just thought oh to hell [with] that we'll cook something and then we traded our guts for brain<br/>
<br/>
Which you know more or less has worked, and I think it's made us a lot more attractive as well<br/>
<br/>
So okay well, so the idea here was that<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's the basic archetype [of] the unknown as such and then I like the st.. George version of this it's so cool because<br/>
<br/>
St.. George lives in a like a castle and the castle is partly falling down and it's partly because there's a dragon<br/>
<br/>
That's come up [to] like it's an eternal dragon<br/>
<br/>
It's come back to giver who in a rough time which always happens<br/>
<br/>
Because there isn't the eternal dragon is always given are giving our fallen down castles a rough time always<br/>
<br/>
And so then St.<br/>
<br/>
[George's] the Hero who goes out to confront the dragon and he<br/>
<br/>
Frees the virgin from its grasp and I would say that's a pretty straightforward<br/>
<br/>
Story about the sexual attractiveness of the masculine spirit that's willing to forthrightly encounter the unknown<br/>
<br/>
That's it looks just straight looks like a straight biological representation to [me], and it's a really really old story<br/>
<br/>
Right it's the oldest written story. We have and that's basically the mesopotamian creation myth<br/>
<br/>
The anu male ish, which which basically lays out precisely that story and so and it's replayed. I mean I bet you<br/>
<br/>
The movie Goers Among you especially the ones that [are] more attracted [to] the superhero. You know they're really flashy sort of<br/>
<br/>
Superhero type movies, you've probably seen the St.<br/>
<br/>
George story like 150 times in the last 10 [years] you never get tired of it because it's the central story of mankind so<br/>
<br/>
you've got the unknown as such and<br/>
<br/>
That is what you react to with your body in the existential terror and extraordinary<br/>
<br/>
Curiosity are gripping you and then it's like the unknown unknowns that<br/>
<br/>
Who's the politician under bush?<br/>
<br/>
Rumsfeld yeah, I think the reason that that phrase caught on so well is because he nailed an archetype<br/>
<br/>
There's unknown unknowns, and there's known unknowns<br/>
<br/>
and that's the unknown unknown and you have to be able to react [to] an unknown unknown because they can get you and<br/>
<br/>
You can't just plead ignorance because then you're dead that doesn't work like human beings are the sort of creature who has to know what?<br/>
<br/>
To do when they don't know what to do, and that's very paradoxical and what we do is we prepare to do everything<br/>
<br/>
That's right<br/>
<br/>
We're on guard we prepare to do everything very very stressful and but also very engaging and very<br/>
<br/>
Very much something that heightens consciousness<br/>
<br/>
and maybe those circuits are<br/>
<br/>
Permanently turned on in human beings because we also know that we're going to die and no other animal knows that and so sometimes I<br/>
<br/>
[think] that our that our stress circuits are just on all the time, and that's part of what accounts for our heightened consciousness<br/>
<br/>
so you have your unknown unknowns and then you have your<br/>
<br/>
relatively you have the unknowns that you actually encounter in the world like the mystery of your of your<br/>
<br/>
Romantic partner when you have a fight [with] them<br/>
<br/>
It's like [well]<br/>
<br/>
We're having a fight who the hell are you [I] mean you're not the absolute unknown because I know something about you<br/>
<br/>
but you're the unknown as its manifesting itself to me right now, right and and and then there's a<br/>
<br/>
known that we inhabit<br/>
<br/>
And then there's the knower and the known is given symbolic representation as far as I've been able to tell in<br/>
<br/>
Patriarchal form in the form of male deities and the unknown as you encountered<br/>
<br/>
it's given Feminine form so<br/>
<br/>
We won't get into that too much but but if you're interested in that you could look at my maps of meetings lectures<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe take a look at the book but I think it's a good. I think it's a good schema for religious archetypes<br/>
<br/>
I've worked on a long time it seems to fit the union Criteria quite nicely. It maps nicely [onto] Joseph Campbell's ideas<br/>
<br/>
He got almost all has ideas from you however<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
It also makes sense from a biological and an evolution a perspective as far as I [can] tell that's a lot of cross validation<br/>
<br/>
at least in my estimation<br/>
<br/>
So okay so back to the hierarchy of dominance. Well, let's take a look at it a little bit, so<br/>
<br/>
I'm quite enamored of lobsters as some of you might know<br/>
<br/>
Because I found out this just blew me away when I found it out.</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">I mean<br/>
<br/>
I I've done a lot of work in Neuro Chemistry<br/>
<br/>
Some similar chemistry because I used to study alcoholism and drug abuse and alcoholism<br/>
<br/>
to study alcohol<br/>
<br/>
You have to know a lot about the brain because alcohol goes<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere in the brain it affects every neural chemical system<br/>
<br/>
And so if you're going to study alcohol it kind of has to study, Neuro chemistry in General<br/>
<br/>
And so I did that [for] [quite] a long time. I really got in a [murud] of a book<br/>
<br/>
Called the Neuro psychology of anxiety by [Jeffery] Gray which is an absolute work of genius although extraordinarily?<br/>
<br/>
Did I don't know how many references that book has it's like?<br/>
<br/>
Must be a thousand and gray actually read them and worse<br/>
<br/>
he understood them and then and then he and then he<br/>
<br/>
integrated them [into] this book and so to read it you have to really master functional neural chemistry and animal Behaviorism and and<br/>
<br/>
Motivation and emotion and neural anatomy like it's a killer book<br/>
<br/>
but man<br/>
<br/>
It's really rich and it's taken psychologists about 40 years to really unpack that book<br/>
<br/>
But one of the things I learned about that was just exactly how much<br/>
<br/>
Continuity there was in the neural chemistry of human beings in the neural chemistry of animals. It's absolutely staggering<br/>
<br/>
It's the sort of thing that makes the fact of evolution something like [self] [evident]<br/>
<br/>
I do think it's self-evident for other reasons that I'll tell you about later. I think evolution or I think natural selection<br/>
<br/>
Random mutation and natural selection is the only way you can solve the problem of how to deal with an environment<br/>
<br/>
That's complex Beyond your ability to comprehend<br/>
<br/>
[I] think what you do is you generate endless variants because [God] only knows what the [hell's] going to happen next<br/>
<br/>
They all almost all [of] them die because they're failures and a couple<br/>
<br/>
propagate and you know the environment keeps moving around like a giant snake you never know what it's going to do next and so the<br/>
<br/>
Best you can do is say well<br/>
<br/>
Here's thirty things that might work, and you know twenty-eight of them are going to perish if you're if you're an insect<br/>
<br/>
It's like the ratio is way way higher than that, so<br/>
<br/>
Anyways back to the lobsters<br/>
<br/>
In all of these so these creatures engage in in<br/>
<br/>
Dominance disputes and and I think dominance is the right way to think about it because lobsters aren't very empathic<br/>
<br/>
And they're not very social and so it really is the toughest lobster that wins<br/>
<br/>
You know and what's so cool [about] the lobster is that?<br/>
<br/>
When a lobster wins he flexes and gets bigger, so he looks bigger because [he's] a winner<br/>
<br/>
It's like he's advertising that and the biological the [neurochemical] system that makes him flex is serotonergic<br/>
<br/>
And you think well who cares what the hell does [that] mean?<br/>
<br/>
Well tell you what it [means]<br/>
<br/>
It's the same chemical that's affected by<br/>
<br/>
Antidepressants in human beings and so like if you're depressed you're a defeated lobster like you're like this. I'm small<br/>
<br/>
I'm not you know things are dangerous. I don't want to fight you give someone an antidepressant<br/>
<br/>
It's like up they stretch, and then they're ready to like take on the world again<br/>
<br/>
Well if you give lobsters who just got defeated in the fight serotonin, then they stretch out and they'll fight again<br/>
<br/>
and that's like we separated from those creatures on the evolutionary timescale somewhere between<br/>
<br/>
350 and 600 million years ago, and the damn Neuro chemistry is the same and so that's another indication of just how<br/>
<br/>
important Hierarchies of Authority are I mean they've been conserved since the time of<br/>
<br/>
Lobsters right there weren't trees around when lobsters first first manifested themselves on the planet<br/>
<br/>
and so what that means is these hierarchies that I've been talking about those things are older than trees and<br/>
<br/>
So one of the truisms for what constitutes real from a Darwinian perspective?<br/>
<br/>
Is that which has been around the longest period of time right because it's had the longest period of time to exert selection pressure<br/>
<br/>
Well, we know we evolved and lived in trees something on the order of 60 million years ago<br/>
<br/>
we're talking [ten] times as far back as that for the<br/>
<br/>
Hierarchy and so the idea that human beings that the hierarchy [is] something that has exerted<br/>
<br/>
Selection pressure on human beings is I don't think that's a disputable. That's not a disputable issue<br/>
<br/>
How it's done it and exactly what that means we can argue about but like that sort of biological<br/>
<br/>
Continuity is just absolutely unbelievable [I]<br/>
<br/>
It was funny because I revealed this finding<br/>
<br/>
I didn't discover this I read about it<br/>
<br/>
But [I] talked to my graduate students about I used to take them out for breakfast you know and they were very<br/>
<br/>
contentious Snappy Bunch and<br/>
<br/>
And they're always trying to one-up each other<br/>
<br/>
And they're quite witty and for like six months until it got very annoying<br/>
<br/>
Every time one of them went up the other they'd stretch themselves out like snap their hands like<br/>
<br/>
So [that] was that was very funny. It was really very funny. So you see this in Lobsters, and so that's pretty amazing so<br/>
<br/>
You know and one of the other thing that's really cool about lobsters<br/>
<br/>
Is that let's say you've been like talk lobster for a long time, but you're getting kind of old and some young<br/>
<br/>
Lobster just you know whales the hell out of you and and so you're all depressed, but thing is your brain is dominant<br/>
<br/>
But you don't have much of a brain because you're a lobster<br/>
<br/>
and so now what are you going to do because you just lost and the answer is while your brain will dissolve and<br/>
<br/>
Then you'll grow a subordinate brain<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, so that's we're thinking about [two] right here for a couple of reasons first of all if any of you have ever been seriously<br/>
<br/>
Defeated in life. You know what that's like. It's like<br/>
<br/>
It's a death a descent a dissolution<br/>
<br/>
and if you're lucky a regrowth<br/>
<br/>
And and maybe not as the same person that's what happens to people with post-traumatic [stress] disorder right their brains undergo permanent neurological<br/>
<br/>
Transformation and<br/>
<br/>
they then<br/>
<br/>
Inhabit a world it's much more dangerous than the world that they inhabited to begin with but we also know - if you have post-traumatic<br/>
<br/>
Stress disorder or depression that your hippocampus shrinks<br/>
<br/>
Right it dies and shrinks and you can sometimes get it to grow back your hippocampus shrinks and your amygdala grows and the amygdala<br/>
<br/>
increases emotional sensitivity and the hippocampus inhibits emotional sensitivity and so if you've been badly defeated the hippocampus shrinks and the amygdala Grows<br/>
<br/>
now if you recover the<br/>
<br/>
hippocampus will regrow and the antidepressants actually seem to help that but the damn amygdala never shrinks again and<br/>
<br/>
So well so that's another lesson from the lobster<br/>
<br/>
It's quite a terrifying one but but it's one like it's so interesting that [you] can relate to that, [right]?<br/>
<br/>
It's like I get what that poor crustacean is going through you know<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
<br/>
Okay, here's the rats and this is from yak [bank] [steps] work rat. He was the first guy who figured out the rats giggle<br/>
<br/>
And you might think well, what kind of stupid thing is that to study is like [$50,000] research grant for giggling rats. You know [aside]?<br/>
<br/>
but<br/>
<br/>
He discovered the play circuitry in mammals. That's a big deal right? It's like discovering a whole new continent<br/>
<br/>
There's a play circuit in mammals<br/>
<br/>
. It's built right in so it's not socially constructed. There's a there's a biological<br/>
<br/>
Platform for that and so what?<br/>
<br/>
[panksepp] would do with rats he found out if rats if you take a rat puff away from its mother it dies<br/>
<br/>
Even if you feed it even if you keep it warm it dies now<br/>
<br/>
you can stop it from dying by taking a pencil with an eraser on the end and<br/>
<br/>
Massaging it right because rats won't live without love and the same thing happens to human babies<br/>
<br/>
And we saw that Romania when there was that<br/>
<br/>
Catastrophe have to tell Chesco in the orphanages where the orphanages were full of unwanted babies because<br/>
<br/>
Ceausescu insisted that every Romanian woman was constantly pregnant<br/>
<br/>
So the orphan is just stacked up with unwanted babies lots of them didn't even have names and they were warehoused warm<br/>
<br/>
shelter food<br/>
<br/>
Devastating lots of them died most of them died before the first year and the ones that didn't die were permanently<br/>
<br/>
dysfunctional because<br/>
<br/>
You have to be touched if you're a human being it's not an option you have to be played with it's not an option<br/>
<br/>
It's it's part of Neural Developmental Necessity<br/>
<br/>
And you have to also play fair, so because otherwise you produce a very disjointed<br/>
<br/>
Child who isn't able to engage in the niceties of social interaction?<br/>
<br/>
Which is continual play in some sense and reciprocity so what panksepp did with his [rat] he noticed that male rats?<br/>
<br/>
juveniles really liked to wrestle and they wrestle just like<br/>
<br/>
humans<br/>
<br/>
Beings wrestle they pinned each other for crying out loud with like that that rat has just lost<br/>
<br/>
He's down for a ten count right and so so what you do is you take Juvenile rats?<br/>
<br/>
And you can find out that they want to play<br/>
<br/>
because<br/>
<br/>
you can attach a spring to them and<br/>
<br/>
Then they'll try to run and you can measure how hard they're running by how hard they're pulling on the spring and then you can<br/>
<br/>
Estimate how motivated they [are] and so you can find out that?<br/>
<br/>
well Fed rat who doesn't have anything on his mind will still work hard to play if<br/>
<br/>
To enter an arena where he's been allowed to play before he'll work [for] that<br/>
<br/>
So that you think while the rats motivated, so the two rats<br/>
<br/>
Go out there<br/>
<br/>
and they play and<br/>
<br/>
And so they're playing like dogs play and everyone knows what that looks like if you're you know what you have any sense about dogs<br/>
<br/>
[they] kind of go like this and kids do that and<br/>
<br/>
maybe you do that with your [wife] if you're gonna play with her a little bit okay my poor my poor wife man when she<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
she was a she was a<br/>
<br/>
Young she had older siblings and so she wasn't played with as</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">much when she was little as she might have been and I<br/>
<br/>
Used to like you know what you take a pill away<br/>
<br/>
And you go like this three times right that means look out a pillow is coming your way<br/>
<br/>
So I go one two [three] wow<br/>
<br/>
But she looked she was completely dismayed at me like what do you do that for and I thought well I?<br/>
<br/>
Eventually taught her that rule the other thing I used to do<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I used to do you know it said sometimes<br/>
<br/>
She'd come at me like this when we were playing round, and I grabbed her wrist<br/>
<br/>
And I'd knock her for her for her hamsters heard not close together. She used to just get completely annoyed about [that] and I thought<br/>
<br/>
Right that's what you do you just opened your hands well. She didn't know that either<br/>
<br/>
So she hadn't been played [with] enough when she was a little [rat] and so<br/>
<br/>
anyways<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, so you let the route the little rats. Go out there, right?<br/>
<br/>
And so let's imagine one [of] them is 10% bigger than other and so that the 10% bigger rat wins<br/>
<br/>
Because 10% is enough in rat way to ensure that you're going to be the pinner rather than the penny, okay?<br/>
<br/>
So so that's fine<br/>
<br/>
so a knit net the rat the rat pins the big rat pins a little rat and now the big rat is the is the<br/>
<br/>
Authority Rat and so then<br/>
<br/>
the next time that the rats play<br/>
<br/>
The little Rod has to invite the big rat to play so the big rats out there being cool and a little that pops up<br/>
<br/>
And you know does the whole will you play with me thing and the big rat will deign to play with it<br/>
<br/>
but if you pair them repeatedly<br/>
<br/>
unless the big rat lets the little rat win 30 percent of the time so little rat will not invite him to play and<br/>
<br/>
Panksepp discovered that it's like I read that that just blew me away<br/>
<br/>
it's like that is so<br/>
<br/>
amazing because you see well first of their there's an analogy to psays ideas about the emergence of<br/>
<br/>
Morality out of play and human being so that was very cool<br/>
<br/>
But the notion that that was built in to rats at the level of wrestling was and their social<br/>
<br/>
They're deeply social animals right they have to know how [to] get along with [one] another and most of their authority<br/>
<br/>
Disputes dominance disputes, you don't want them to end in bloodshed and combat because you know if your rat won<br/>
<br/>
And I'm rat [2] and we tear each other to shreds<br/>
<br/>
In a dominance dispute rat 3 is just going to move in it's really not a great<br/>
<br/>
Strategy and so be better if we could settle our differences<br/>
<br/>
You know somewhat peacefully and so while so rat anyway peg's had figured out that rats<br/>
<br/>
Play and not only [did] they play they play fair and they [seemed] to enjoy it he also figured out<br/>
<br/>
This was really cool [to] that if you give juvenile rats<br/>
<br/>
attention deficit disorder drugs<br/>
<br/>
Ritalin<br/>
<br/>
suppresses prey play<br/>
<br/>
So that's worth thinking about. It's like well. Why do you have to give?<br/>
<br/>
Juvenile Human beings<br/>
<br/>
Amphetamines in school well because they need to play well, you know they don't get to play you know get to wrestle around<br/>
<br/>
I mean that's oppression as far as I can tell they don't get to wrestle around that's fine feed them some amphetamines man<br/>
<br/>
[that'll] shut down the old play circuits. Well is the other problem is panksepp found out that if you don't let Juvenile male rats play?<br/>
<br/>
Their prefrontal cortexes don't develop properly<br/>
<br/>
Surprise surprise, you're not letting them [ensure]<br/>
<br/>
It's like what else would you expect so you know that's something to think about really hard, I would say so<br/>
<br/>
Well, so there's some wolves going at it, [and] [we're] all [hunting] not exactly there's some moves<br/>
<br/>
having an Authority dispute, but<br/>
<br/>
More technically speaking<br/>
<br/>
And a lot of [its] posturing you know they tend they tend [not] well<br/>
<br/>
Socialized wolves tend not to hurt each other during authority disputes because well for over obvious reasons<br/>
<br/>
It's too dangerous and so they have other ways of demonstrating who should be listen to authorities<br/>
<br/>
And there's chimps doing you have this particular house. I think if I remember correctly I think it's right<br/>
<br/>
This is a really cool picture because I think this chimp chimps don't like snakes by the way<br/>
<br/>
So for example if you take a chimp that's never seen a snake<br/>
<br/>
And you show it a snake it is not. Happy it will get the hell away from that snake if you bring a chimp<br/>
<br/>
Anesthetized into a roomful of chimps the chips will all get away from that and then look at the body<br/>
<br/>
they don't like that either and<br/>
<br/>
if you bring a big snake into a chimp cage even if the chimps have never seen it like they'll get away from it and<br/>
<br/>
Then stare at it and chimps out in the wild if they see a big snake<br/>
<br/>
They'll they'll stand there and they have a noise that means it's like holy crap. That's a big snake you know<br/>
<br/>
It actually means that technically, I'll tell you why in a minute<br/>
<br/>
But they get they stand away from it then they make this this<br/>
<br/>
Noise which means oh my [God] look at the snake<br/>
<br/>
and then they'll stand there for like 24 hours looking at the snake and so the snakes are really really they're super stimuli for<br/>
<br/>
Chimpanzees<br/>
<br/>
So that's pretty interesting in this chimp seem to learn how to take this dead snake and go<br/>
<br/>
scare other chips with it and that was<br/>
<br/>
That was hardly how he established his authority and you know and [while] there?<br/>
<br/>
There's a there's a there's a threat, and you like if I was you, [and] I was around that chimp<br/>
<br/>
I would take that threat seriously because those things are no joke man<br/>
<br/>
And you see the same thing here with the I don't remember what kind of monkey that is but they're engaged in<br/>
<br/>
agonistic Behavior and so<br/>
<br/>
From so and there has been by the way there has been<br/>
<br/>
Recent research showing that in higher order primates that [there] is snake Detection circuitry that's built into them right so it's not learned<br/>
<br/>
It's not learned deeper than that now for a long time<br/>
<br/>
Psychologist psychologist knew for a long time that I could make you afraid in a conditioning experience<br/>
<br/>
Experiment much faster using a snake or a picture of the snake than a gun or a picture of a gun<br/>
<br/>
So we can learn fear [to] snakes very rapidly spiders as well, and so then people thought well<br/>
<br/>
maybe we were prepared to develop fear to snakes or<br/>
<br/>
spiders that sort of thing<br/>
<br/>
But the more recent research has indicated that it's more than just<br/>
<br/>
prepared is that we have the Detection circuitry built right into us and<br/>
<br/>
Well is because well why wouldn't we that's that's really the [issue]. It's like<br/>
<br/>
It's not really [that] much of a surprise unless you think of human beings as a blank slate<br/>
<br/>
And if you think that [been] I don't know you should crawl out of the 16th century<br/>
<br/>
That's that's all I would look I would look at it because I mean that's that's that's just go on that idea<br/>
<br/>
it's it's it's so wrong, so<br/>
<br/>
So maybe you can think about this as a dominance hierarchy, but wolves look for those wolves look for<br/>
<br/>
Credibility and competence as well and and chimpanzees don't like Brutal tyrants<br/>
<br/>
And so we'll talk about it as the hierarchy of authority and so well. This is kind of how it starts to [develop]<br/>
<br/>
You know you see well these girls are negotiating the domestic environment here<br/>
<br/>
and how to behave properly and how to share and all that and turn and take turns<br/>
<br/>
And so they're negotiating the hierarchy of authority and if you're good at reciprocity<br/>
<br/>
It's sometimes you're the authority and sometimes the other person is the authority that's fair play, right?<br/>
<br/>
And so these boys are doing the same thing and you see they're all smiling away<br/>
<br/>
And so it looks like aggressive behavior and people who are not?<br/>
<br/>
Very attentive and who are paranoid and who don't like?<br/>
<br/>
Human beings can confuse this with aggression and they forbid it at schools<br/>
<br/>
Which is you know I know when my kids were going to school for example. This was quite a while ago now<br/>
<br/>
They were forbidden to pick up snow on the off chance<br/>
<br/>
They might throw a snowball and we know how terrible that is<br/>
<br/>
So what I told my son was [that] he was perfectly welcome to pelt any teacher he wanted to in the back of the head<br/>
<br/>
with the snowball as long as he was willing to<br/>
<br/>
Suffer the consequences of doing it, and I don't know if he ever did<br/>
<br/>
But he was happy with he was certainly happy with the idea which made me very [happy] about him, so<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, so so you know kids need to do this they really really<br/>
<br/>
Seriously need to do this<br/>
<br/>
it's what civilize --is them and [they] that needs to happen [between] the ages of [two] and [four] because if they're not<br/>
<br/>
Civilized by the time they're [4] then you might as well<br/>
<br/>
Just forget it, and that's a that's a horrible statistic<br/>
<br/>
but it's unbelievably well borne out in the relevant developmental literature like there's lots of aggressive two-Year-olds most of them are male and<br/>
<br/>
If they stay aggressive past the age of four they tend to be lifetime aggressive. They make no friends. They're outcasts<br/>
<br/>
they're much more likely to end up antisocial criminal Delinquent and in jail and so<br/>
<br/>
Your kids need to be socialized between the ages of two and four<br/>
<br/>
And that's particularly true for the more aggressive males and most of the rest of two-year-olds are male and that isn't socialization by the way<br/>
<br/>
So there's a [more--not] more abstract representation of the same sort of thing<br/>
<br/>
And I'm trying to make the case [that] this that the that the hierarchy of authority emerges out of a [game-like]<br/>
<br/>
Matrix an Underlying Game-like Matrix<br/>
<br/>
And that's one of the things that one of the things that's so brilliant about Jean Piaget he figured that out<br/>
<br/>
it's so smart and he was interested in the biological origin of morality and he identified it he he he<br/>
<br/>
Traced the origin to play and the emergence of morality out of play, and that's it's so smart<br/>
<br/>
[it's] just I [just] can't believe how smart an idea that was because it's the [bottom-up]<br/>
<br/>
construction of of<br/>
<br/>
Morality now Piaget was [a] constructionist and to some degree social constructionist<br/>
<br/>
He underestimated the role of biology, but that doesn't invalidate</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">his theory. It's really easy to put a biological underpinning underneath<br/>
<br/>
underneath pas theory, we know the biology well enough to do it quite quite nicely now so I mean we<br/>
<br/>
well the fact that tanks have for example [could] identify the play circuit is a really good start with that right because<br/>
<br/>
Play has been around so [long] that. We have a circuit. That's dedicated to it and so that's that's a very very ancient<br/>
<br/>
That's a very ancient issue<br/>
<br/>
And so you know this is this is very much of an abstraction of a game here, and then of course you get the ultimate<br/>
<br/>
abstraction in representation, what in a representation like<br/>
<br/>
like that<br/>
<br/>
Where even though even the landscape of the game is fictional and of course we've migrated to a large degree [into] those sorts of fictional<br/>
<br/>
landscapes<br/>
<br/>
fictional books movies<br/>
<br/>
video games<br/>
<br/>
so it's the same it's an extension of the same thing so practice for<br/>
<br/>
practice for real life the Shades in some cases into real life itself, so<br/>
<br/>
Alright<br/>
<br/>
More representations of God the father I like these representations. I like the triangle<br/>
<br/>
Idea I mean I [don't] know why God is wearing a triangular hat it's kind of a strange fashion choice<br/>
<br/>
but I think it's<br/>
<br/>
Associated with the idea of the pyramid and I think that's associated with the idea of the hierarchy of Authority and I think that's why<br/>
<br/>
the Egyptians put their pharaohs inside pyramids<br/>
<br/>
I know, there's more to it than [that]<br/>
<br/>
But I think some of that has [to] do with the notion of this hierarchical structure you see this on that now<br/>
<br/>
that's speculative obviously and I don't want to make too much [of] it, but<br/>
<br/>
But I can't help but think that there's something to that see that's on the back of [the] American Dollar Bill<br/>
<br/>
I like that a lot<br/>
<br/>
[that's] like the eye of horus from the egyptians and so the idea here is something like<br/>
<br/>
At the top of the Hierarchy is something that is no longer part of the hierarchy<br/>
<br/>
Right, so if you move up the hierarchy enough what happens is [that] you develop the [ability] as a consequence of moving up that hierarchy<br/>
<br/>
To be detached enough from the Hierarchy, so you're no longer really part of it<br/>
<br/>
And so [that] you can move in all sorts of different hierarchies and the thing the idea here is [that] the thing [that] you're really?<br/>
<br/>
Developing is the capacity to pay attention, and I would say from a from<br/>
<br/>
mythological perspective the the one thing that seems to compete with the idea of the spoken word as<br/>
<br/>
the as the source of the<br/>
<br/>
Extraction of habitable order from Chaos is the [I] is the capacity to pay attention so marduk for example the mesopotamian creator. God who?<br/>
<br/>
emerged in the hierarchy of<br/>
<br/>
Mesopotamian gods and came out at the top right he was the victor of the gods<br/>
<br/>
He had eyes all the way around his head and he could speak Magic words, and I really like that<br/>
<br/>
I really like that idea and the egyptians developed that idea too because their God horus was the eye<br/>
<br/>
Everyone knew was the eye of [horus] that that sense that image is so compelling that we still know [about]<br/>
<br/>
everybody has seen the eye of [horus] with a really open pupil and<br/>
<br/>
What the egyptians learned was that the open eye was what revivified the dead society it's so smart<br/>
<br/>
So what do you do if your life? Isn't in order bloody well pay attention and that isn't the same as thinking<br/>
<br/>
It's a different process paying attention thinking is like the imposition of structure in some sense<br/>
<br/>
I know I'm oversimplifying but paying attention is something like watching for what you don't know and<br/>
<br/>
So like one of the things I often recommend to my clinical clients if they're having trouble with a family member is<br/>
<br/>
Number one, shut up. Don't tell them anything about yourself just and I don't mean in a rude way<br/>
<br/>
It's just like no more personal information<br/>
<br/>
number [two] watch them like a hawk and listen and if you do that long enough<br/>
<br/>
They will tell you exactly what they're up to<br/>
<br/>
And they will also tell you who they [think] you are and then you'll be shocked because they think you're something generally speaking<br/>
<br/>
That's not like you what you are at all and when they tell you it's like a revelation to both of you<br/>
<br/>
But attention [is] an unbelievably powerful force, and you see this in psychotherapy<br/>
<br/>
Too because a lot of what you do and in any<br/>
<br/>
Reparative relationship is really pay attention to another person<br/>
<br/>
pay attention and listen<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
you would not believe what people will tell [you] or reveal to you if you watch them as if you want to know instead of<br/>
<br/>
watching them so that you'll have your<br/>
<br/>
prejudices<br/>
<br/>
Reinforced that's usually how people interact is like. I want to keep thinking about you the way<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking about you, and so I'm going to filter out anything that just proves my theory<br/>
<br/>
That's not what I'm talking about at all. It's like<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to watch you and figure [out] what you're up to. [not] in a rude way none of [that]<br/>
<br/>
I just want to see what's there and that'll be good for you<br/>
<br/>
Probably and also be good for me, and so well, so that's the idea that<br/>
<br/>
you know climbing up a hierarchy of authority can give you vision and that vision can<br/>
<br/>
transcend the actual Hierarchy, and I think that's also the I think that's also the<br/>
<br/>
That's the metaphysical space that an artist occupies because artists really aren't in a hierarchy there outside of hierarchies<br/>
<br/>
You've watched the Lion king most of you yeah<br/>
<br/>
That's that Zoo you know the little bird<br/>
<br/>
that's the eye of the king that's the same thing there so and that's that's echoed in this idea as well, so<br/>
<br/>
So well that's some more<br/>
<br/>
More ideas of Hierarchies same idea. This is right gold<br/>
<br/>
Silver Bronze, why gold gold is the sun [gold] is pure right?<br/>
<br/>
So the idea is that the thing that's at the top of the hierarchy is incorruptible because gold doesn't mix with anything else, right?<br/>
<br/>
It's this sort of metal that doesn't ever become corrupted. It's a noble metal<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't become corrupted, and so it Shines like the sun<br/>
<br/>
And it's associated with what's ever at the top of the [hierarchy] and the gold<br/>
<br/>
The gold Medal is a disc like the sun, and it's awarded to those people who?<br/>
<br/>
Occupied the top position and who are manifestations of the ideal and here's here's I can tell you a quick story<br/>
<br/>
[so] imagine that you're watching an olympic contest<br/>
<br/>
[I] found this happens to me very often with gymnastics because the gymnasts are so absolutely unbelievable you know<br/>
<br/>
so you go watch the gymnastic performance and<br/>
<br/>
the verse is out there bouncing around like<br/>
<br/>
You know you can't even imagine doing it. They're so perfect at it. So you see this person they're going through this routine<br/>
<br/>
They're just absolutely<br/>
<br/>
Spectacular and flawless at it. You know at the [end]<br/>
<br/>
They stop and everybody claps and and they're all excited to see what a human being can do and that's why we're in the audience<br/>
<br/>
Watching because we want to see what a human being can do and the judges go like 9.8 9.8 9.8<br/>
<br/>
Everybody's thrilled and then the next contestant comes out, and it's [like] well<br/>
<br/>
They're just basically screwed right it's like this person came out there and was perfect<br/>
<br/>
How are you going to top that that's an interesting question because this<br/>
<br/>
Is a representation of what you do to top?<br/>
<br/>
Perfection itself and you can do it [and] here's how you do it<br/>
<br/>
And you know this even though you don't know you know it, so let's say the next contestant comes out<br/>
<br/>
They're kind of shaky because it's like oh man the bar is being raised high so what they do is<br/>
<br/>
they put themselves right on the edge of Chaos and<br/>
<br/>
You can tell by watching them that they are one bloody fraction of a second from Catastrophe<br/>
<br/>
[they're] pushing themselves farther than they've ever gone in the direction of their perfection [and]<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in the room is so tense they can hardly stand it right you can hear a pin drop and that person is flipping around<br/>
<br/>
It they're just it's just right on the edge of catastrophe [and] at the end<br/>
<br/>
They go like this, you know<br/>
<br/>
And there's that gesture of triumph that goes along with that and everybody rises in one instant and just claps like mad<br/>
<br/>
It's like well, why what are you doing? What are you doing? When you're doing that right?<br/>
<br/>
You can't even help it it grabs you right in the core of your being and you stand up<br/>
<br/>
And it's it's an act of worship. That's what it is and you saw someone<br/>
<br/>
Go Beyond their perfection into the domain of Chaos and establish order right in front of your eyes<br/>
<br/>
And you're so thrilled about that you know you're happy to be alive<br/>
<br/>
And everyone's celebrating it all at the same time, and it's an absolutely amazing thing, and that's what well sometimes<br/>
<br/>
That's what this represents and sometimes that's what this represents<br/>
<br/>
And that's what we're trying to get at because that's at the pinnacle of the hierarchy right not only are you doing?<br/>
<br/>
What you should be [doing]?<br/>
<br/>
but you're doing it in a way that increases the probability that you'll do it better the next time you do it and<br/>
<br/>
[then] you could say here's another thing to think about along the same lines<br/>
<br/>
And I know we haven't got that [out] of an easy yet<br/>
<br/>
You tell your kids to play fair right you say [Norman] it's not [whether] [not] you win. It's how you play the game and<br/>
<br/>
You say that you don't really know what you mean you feel kind of stupid saying it even though<br/>
<br/>
You know it's true and your kid looks at you like there's something wrong with you because he doesn't know what you're talking about either<br/>
<br/>
but you know it's true [and]<br/>
<br/>
So here's why it's true<br/>
<br/>
Life isn't a game. It's a set of games and<br/>
<br/>
The rule is never Sacrifice victory across the set of games for victory and one game<br/>
<br/>
Right and that's what it means to play<br/>
<br/>
Properly you want to play so that people keep inviting you [to] play because that's how you win<br/>
<br/>
Right you win by being invited to play the largest possible array of games and the way you do that is by<br/>
<br/>
Manifesting the fact that you can play in a reciprocal</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">manner every time you play even if there's victory at stake<br/>
<br/>
And that's what makes you successful across time<br/>
<br/>
And we all know that and we even tell our kids that but we don't know [that] we know it and so we're not<br/>
<br/>
adapting ourselves to the game and Victory in the game<br/>
<br/>
We're adapting ourselves to the [metagame] and victory across the set of all possible games, and that's what that well<br/>
<br/>
That's exactly what as far as I can tell that's exactly what this is aiming at to that. That's the same idea that<br/>
<br/>
There's that there's a transit. There's a mode of being that transcends the particularities of [the] of the localized contests<br/>
<br/>
That's the other way to think about it and to act morally is not to win<br/>
<br/>
today's contest at the expense of the rest of possible contests and<br/>
<br/>
Again, I don't see that as something that's arbitrary it's not relativistic<br/>
<br/>
there's an absolute Moral an absolute Moral stance there and everyone recognizes it and<br/>
<br/>
And I also think it's the key to success<br/>
<br/>
and I would also say it's very much akin in a strange way like the the the person who is the master at<br/>
<br/>
Being invited to play the largest possible games number of games is also the same person<br/>
<br/>
I haven't quite figured out the precise [relationship] between these two is also the same person that goes out<br/>
<br/>
Forthrightly to conquer the unknown before it presents itself as the enemy at the door. They're the same thing now<br/>
<br/>
I don't I can't haven't figured well. Why that is exactly but but<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'll figure it out eventually and when I do I'll don't tell you well<br/>
<br/>
if you're interested, so<br/>
<br/>
okay, so here's the mother no ideas of<br/>
<br/>
God as as<br/>
<br/>
Hierarchical authority figures so strip the religious preconceptions off what you observe and just look at what you see well look there's primate<br/>
<br/>
looking upward Ad<br/>
<br/>
Dominance figure, that's that's what you see there now<br/>
<br/>
It's very interestingly<br/>
<br/>
symbolically<br/>
<br/>
Represented because you have gone<br/>
<br/>
The farther there with the cross and I think what that [means] as far as I can tell is [that] there's a recognition there in<br/>
<br/>
the image that the person who's most dominant is the one who's or the most have the most [authority] is the one who's<br/>
<br/>
Voluntarily accepted the suffering that's part of being and that's what that picture represents<br/>
<br/>
It's like the authority holds that says this is what you have to accept and that that that that transfix is the viewer<br/>
<br/>
Because of because of the fact that it's true, and you think well is that true, okay? Well think about it this way?<br/>
<br/>
Do you like brave people or do you like cowards?<br/>
<br/>
Well that that's pretty straightforward and what's the ultimate act of Bravery?<br/>
<br/>
It's to come to terms with the fact that you're mortal and limited and to live forthrightly<br/>
<br/>
Regardless well obviously that's at the core of what's of what's admirable and why would we presume that that's not the case<br/>
<br/>
We act as if that's the case. It's what everyone dreams and wishes that they could they could do I mean assuming that?<br/>
<br/>
You know you've dispensed with the idea that you're going to be immortal<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that might be worth wishing for [too] or or perhaps not immortal is a very long time<br/>
<br/>
But you certainly want this and that [image] says well<br/>
<br/>
This is what you should be and you [know] we've got that same<br/>
<br/>
Opening into the sky going on in that image that I showed you before it's like<br/>
<br/>
This is a transcendent truth that constantly reman efest itself across time and space and jung would say it's built into your psyche that<br/>
<br/>
Image now you know there are elements of it [that] are culturally constructed it wouldn't [necessarily] have to be the cross<br/>
<br/>
Although the cross is a very old symbol. It's far older than then it's use in Christianity. It has been used in many many<br/>
<br/>
religious<br/>
<br/>
representations, but that echoes the soul echoes with that you know and<br/>
<br/>
Well, then there's moses up there on [the] on the mount<br/>
<br/>
Receiving these the the law and so we'll talk a lot more about that when we get to exodus<br/>
<br/>
but if yeah yeah, yeah<br/>
<br/>
If we get to exodus so well look where does it happen well on the mountain. Well, that's a pyramid<br/>
<br/>
That's up right. That's optics up. It's it's up in stratosphere is up in the sky where where you look upward, okay?<br/>
<br/>
And and then so what's happening to moses well here?<br/>
<br/>
Here's a bit of a clue as far as I can tell [I]<br/>
<br/>
Figured this out partly again by reading jean Piaget because one of the things that pSA said about kids was that<br/>
<br/>
They first learned to play a game<br/>
<br/>
But they don't know what the rules are meaning that if you have a bunch of kids together they can play a game<br/>
<br/>
but if you take one of the kids out of the game when they're young say six, and you say<br/>
<br/>
What the rule are what are the rules they can only sort of give you a representation?<br/>
<br/>
So you take six-year-old one and he'll tell you some of the rules and six-year-old two will tell you different rules and and you know<br/>
<br/>
Six-year-Old three will tell you different rules, but if you put them all together they can play so they have the knowledge<br/>
<br/>
Embodied either individually or [in] the group the knowledge is there<br/>
<br/>
to be extracted well then they get a little older they can extract the rules and<br/>
<br/>
Then they start to play by the rules [and] then the CSA's last step was well<br/>
<br/>
they didn't just the kids play by the rules that they learned that they can make the rules and<br/>
<br/>
He thought about that as moral progression first you can play then you can play by the rules then you learn<br/>
<br/>
Maybe because he didn't think everyone learned this that you're actually the master of the rules [that] [doesn't] mean the rules are arbitrary<br/>
<br/>
But it means that<br/>
<br/>
You could be the generator of the rule that's assuming that you know how to play the game<br/>
<br/>
And he thought about that as a Moral Moral progression<br/>
<br/>
And then I thought well that's exactly what happened [to] moses in in the story of exodus because moses is out there leading all those<br/>
<br/>
Israelites around and like they don't have a law they don't have a lawgiver<br/>
<br/>
They have a tradition, and they're all like crabby because both are in a desert. It's like<br/>
<br/>
They're in a tyranny, but now they're in a desert. It's like. That's no improvement<br/>
<br/>
So they're really getting pretty bitchy about it<br/>
<br/>
and so they're worshipping False idols and having one catastrophe after another and they get moses to judge their<br/>
<br/>
Conflicts so he does that for God only knows how long forever crabby israelites come to moses and bitch at him<br/>
<br/>
It's like wow he did this and she did that and and so then he has to figure out how<br/>
<br/>
[to] make peace<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
He does that so long that one of his I think it's his father-in-law tells him he has to stop doing it because he's going<br/>
<br/>
To exhaust himself [well] then you think well, what's happening? Well?<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not assuming that this is a like a literal historical story. I think again<br/>
<br/>
It's a condensation. Well any group has a set of customs<br/>
<br/>
Just like a wolf pack does and so then the customs are being manifest in someone. Who's a genius is watching and thinking okay?<br/>
<br/>
Well, what's the rule in this situation? What's the rule in this situation? What's the rule in this situation and then in his imagination<br/>
<br/>
[the] rules turn into a hierarchy and then he goes up on the mountain [just] bang and he thinks oh my God<br/>
<br/>
Here's the rules that we've been living by all this time, and that's the revelation of the commandments well, and you think well<br/>
<br/>
How else could it be you think the rules came first and baying them came second? It's like no the rules come first<br/>
<br/>
Sorry the actions come first the obeying them comes first<br/>
<br/>
And then you figure out what everybody's up to you say hey look this is what you've been up to all [along] everybody goes oh<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that seems to make sense peak and if it didn't who would follow them<br/>
<br/>
no one was going to follow them if they don't match what's already there you just think about that is unjust and so that's that's<br/>
<br/>
portrayed here as A<br/>
<br/>
Cataclysmic human event it's like oh my God we've been chimpanzees. We've been in this hierarchy of authority for so long<br/>
<br/>
we have no idea what we're doing and all of a sudden poof it bursts into<br/>
<br/>
Revelatory consciousness, and we could say here is the law and you say well is it given by God well?<br/>
<br/>
Hey it depends on what you [mean] [by] God we could start with [that] presupposition, but it's not like it<br/>
<br/>
Just came out of nowhere it took it and this is something else Nietzsche observed<br/>
<br/>
so interestingly, and he said you know that a moral revelation was the consequence of a<br/>
<br/>
tremendously long process of initial<br/>
<br/>
construction and then formulation thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of years of<br/>
<br/>
custom a building custom before you get the revelation of the<br/>
<br/>
Articulated law and that's a description of the pattern [that] works. Let's say well. What's the pattern that works?<br/>
<br/>
It's the game that you can [play] with everybody else day after day with no degeneration<br/>
<br/>
And that's another thing piaget figured out. It's so brilliant, and that's his idea of the equilibrate state<br/>
<br/>
it's an extension of the [menu'] accounts idea about the universe [Maksim] right act in a way so that each action could become a<br/>
<br/>
Universal rule that was Kinda Mental Moral Maxim and PSa put a twist on that. He said no, no, that's not exactly yet. [it's]<br/>
<br/>
Act in such a way that it works for you now<br/>
<br/>
And next week and next month and next year and ten years from now and so that while it's working for you<br/>
<br/>
it's also working for the people around you and for the broader society and<br/>
<br/>
Then and that's the equilibrate estate<br/>
<br/>
And you could think about that as an intimation of [the] [kingdom] of the city of God on Earth<br/>
<br/>
It's something like that<br/>
<br/>
And it's based on this idea that a morality has to be iterable<br/>
<br/>
And you know there's lots of there's been lots of simulations online already artificial intelligence simulations of trading games<br/>
<br/>
Right I mean the people who've been studying the emergence of Moral behavior</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">say in artificial intelligence<br/>
<br/>
Systems have already caught on to the idea that one of the crucial elements to the analysis of morality is inner ability<br/>
<br/>
you can't play a degenerating game because<br/>
<br/>
Because it degenerates<br/>
<br/>
Like obviously you want to play a game that at least [remains] stable across time and God if you could really get your act together<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would slowly get better and of course that's what you'd hope for your family, right?<br/>
<br/>
That's what you're always trying to do unless you're completely hell-bent on revenge and destruction<br/>
<br/>
It's like is there a way that we can continue to play together that will make playing together even better the next day<br/>
<br/>
that's what you're up to and<br/>
<br/>
Well, I don't see anything arbitrary about that [and] part of it. This is also<br/>
<br/>
why I think that bloody post modernists are so incorrect because you know they say something like there's an infinite number of interpretations of<br/>
<br/>
The world and that's actually true<br/>
<br/>
But then they make a mistake and they say well, no<br/>
<br/>
Interpretation is to be privileged over any other interpretation. It's like wrong<br/>
<br/>
wrong that's that's where things go seriously off the rails because the<br/>
<br/>
Interpretation has to be and this is the piagetian<br/>
<br/>
Objection is like if you and I are going to play a game rule one is we both have to want to play<br/>
<br/>
Rule two is other people are going to let us play rule 3 is we should be able to play it across a pretty long<br/>
<br/>
Period of time without it degenerating and maybe rule 4 is well. We're playing the world shouldn't kill us<br/>
<br/>
It's like there are not very many [gay] like you don't send your kids out to play on the superhighway, right?<br/>
<br/>
So they're not playing hockey on the superhighway because the world kills them and so<br/>
<br/>
There's an infinite [number] of interpretations<br/>
<br/>
But there is not an infinite number of solutions [and] the solutions are<br/>
<br/>
Constrained by the fact of the world and are suffering in the world and then also constrained by the fact that we constrain each other<br/>
<br/>
And so that's that's where. I think that's gone like dreadfully dreadfully wrong, so<br/>
<br/>
All right<br/>
<br/>
It's really fun to look at these old pictures once you kind of know what they mean, you know the leaf<br/>
<br/>
That's what I've discovered. Is that once I kind of understand the underlying<br/>
<br/>
Rationale for I mean someone worked hard on that that's an engraving right they took a long time making that picture<br/>
<br/>
They're serious about it and when you understand what it means<br/>
<br/>
You know all those people there their prostate prostrate at the at the at the revelation of the law?<br/>
<br/>
It's like well, no wonder<br/>
<br/>
It's like break the law and see what happens breaks the universal Moral law man and see what happens<br/>
<br/>
You know I see people in that situation<br/>
<br/>
Well as you all do all the time perhaps me more than you because I'm a clinical psychologist<br/>
<br/>
you know and if the people I'm seeing haven't broken the<br/>
<br/>
Universal law then you can bloody well be sure that people around them have it's no joke<br/>
<br/>
Like you make a mistake and things will go seriously wrong for you, and so it's no wonder that. You'd be<br/>
<br/>
Terrified at the revelation of the structure that governs our being one of the things that's so remarkable about the old testament<br/>
<br/>
This is another thing Nietzsche commented on: he was a real admirer of the old testament not so much of the new testament<br/>
<br/>
He thought it was a sin for Europe to have glued the new testament on to the old testament<br/>
<br/>
[because] he thought the old testament was a really accurate<br/>
<br/>
representation of the phenomenology of Being. It's like<br/>
<br/>
stay awake speak properly be honest or<br/>
<br/>
Watch the hell out<br/>
<br/>
Because things will come your [way] that you just do not want to see at all and it might not [just] be you it might<br/>
<br/>
Be everyone you know and everything about your culture that is demolished for for generation after generation. It's like<br/>
<br/>
Stay awake and be careful<br/>
<br/>
And I like I think that people only don't believe that when they're being hubristic<br/>
<br/>
And I think that most people know that deep in their hearts<br/>
<br/>
You know when you get high on your horse that happens fairly often if you have any sense you think geez I better be careful<br/>
<br/>
[top] myself down and fare a bit because if I get too puffed up man<br/>
<br/>
Something's going to come along and take me out at the knees and everyone knows that pride comes before a fall<br/>
<br/>
It's like if you have any that's why it says in the old [testament] that fear of God is the beginning of wisdom<br/>
<br/>
[it's] like I've never in all my years as a clinical psychologist, and this is something that really does terrify me<br/>
<br/>
I have I have never seen anyone ever get away with anything at all even once you [know]<br/>
<br/>
There's that old idea that. God has a book you know and keeps track of everything in heaven. It's like okay<br/>
<br/>
Okay, [you] know maybe it's not a book<br/>
<br/>
fine<br/>
<br/>
But that is a really useful thing to think about because well, maybe you disagree<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you think people get away with things all the time<br/>
<br/>
I tell you I've never seen it what I see instead<br/>
<br/>
is [that] thing happens right they someone twists the fabric of reality and<br/>
<br/>
They do it successfully because it doesn't snap back at them that moment and then like two years later something<br/>
<br/>
Unravels, and they get walloped and they think oh my God that's so unfair and then we track it<br/>
<br/>
It's like but what happened before that this and then what this and then what this and then what oh?<br/>
<br/>
Oh this well that's where it went wrong. It's yeah, because you can't twist the fabric of reality<br/>
<br/>
without having it snap back<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't work that way, [and] why would it because what are you going to do twist the fabric of reality?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think so<br/>
<br/>
I think it's bigger than you. You know<br/>
<br/>
And I think that one of the things that really tempts people is the idea that well, I can get away with it<br/>
<br/>
It's like yeah you try you see. Oh, well that works<br/>
<br/>
It's like you get away with nothing and that is the beginning of wisdom and I it's something that deeply terrifies me<br/>
<br/>
And you know err ever since?<br/>
<br/>
last September when I<br/>
<br/>
Came to Board like broader public<br/>
<br/>
attention one of the thing I'd be terrified [of] making [mistake] because I certainly know I'm more than capable of making a mistake and<br/>
<br/>
Going so far either. I haven't made [one] or no one found out about it, so<br/>
<br/>
But it's like you know we walk on a very thin and narrow Edge<br/>
<br/>
and we're very lucky when things aren't degenerating into Chaos around us or<br/>
<br/>
Rapidly moving too far too much order<br/>
<br/>
and it's not an easy thing to stay on that line and<br/>
<br/>
You can tell when you say you're on that line because the things are deeply meaningful and engaging when you're on that line<br/>
<br/>
but if you're not<br/>
<br/>
Existentially terrified about the consequences of wavering off that then you are truly, not awake<br/>
<br/>
So and that's what I see in this picture<br/>
<br/>
You know it's like look out man, because there are rules and if you break them<br/>
<br/>
God help you<br/>
<br/>
so one of the things that seems to me the case with regard this in the question period A bit last time is that<br/>
<br/>
one of the things that seems to be actually one of the<br/>
<br/>
Advantages to gluing the new testament on to the old testament is the idea of a transformation and morality that is analogous to the pia<br/>
<br/>
Jetty an idea that<br/>
<br/>
After you learn to play [by] the rules you can learn to make the rules because I think that's actually what happens to some degree<br/>
<br/>
in the transition between the [old] testament and the new testament<br/>
<br/>
Because in the old testament most morality is prohibition<br/>
<br/>
Here are things you shouldn't do. It's like no fair enough. That's a lot of what you do with your kids<br/>
<br/>
Don't do this don't do this don't<br/>
<br/>
Especially when they're happy you're always going around telling them to stop being so happy because all they're doing is causing trouble<br/>
<br/>
It's quite painful if you're a parent and you notice that but the first morality is prohibition<br/>
<br/>
right<br/>
<br/>
Control yourself so you don't cause too much trouble and then maybe if you get that down<br/>
<br/>
And you're good at it, then the next thing is well once you're disciplined<br/>
<br/>
then you can start working [toward] something that's a positive good, and that's the transformation that seems to me to [be] fundamentally characteristic of the<br/>
<br/>
Juxtaposition of the new testament on to the old testament, but in these images is still something like serve tradition serve the father<br/>
<br/>
psychologically speaking support the tradition because<br/>
<br/>
You live on it<br/>
<br/>
they're in an old mesopotamian story the enumeration you can which you can read about if you're interested [in] the<br/>
<br/>
Original gods who are really badly behaved? They're like two year [old] in fact. They're a lot like two year olds<br/>
<br/>
They kill the primordial gone absolute<br/>
<br/>
Pea tree oracle God they kill him and try to live on his corpse<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's what we all do right because we live on the corpse of our ancestors<br/>
<br/>
You could say we live on the corpse of our culture<br/>
<br/>
It's dead<br/>
<br/>
And that's not a great place [to] live [so] you have to keep revivifying it so the damn thing<br/>
<br/>
You know stays<br/>
<br/>
Active and awake you you stay [on] the carbs for too long and then the devil or the Demon of Chaos comes back<br/>
<br/>
And that's what happens in the mesopotamian story<br/>
<br/>
It's like don't be thinking that you can stay on the corpse of your ancestors for too long without<br/>
<br/>
Contributing to the revivification of the system because the Chaos that all of that holds that that all that<br/>
<br/>
holds that bay will definitely come and visit you you [see] that in stories like<br/>
<br/>
The Hobbit you know hobbits. They're nice they like to eat. [they're] kind of fat. They're shorts are not very bright you know<br/>
<br/>
They're hubristic. They have no idea. What's out there in the broader world<br/>
<br/>
They're protected if you remember by the striders who are the sons of great Kings who look like?<br/>
<br/>
Tramps they have nothing but contempt for them they patrol the borders and keep the Bloody hobbits safe<br/>
<br/>
But out there out there in the periphery all hell is brewing and Chaos</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">is is is<br/>
<br/>
Generating and forming and that's an archetypal story<br/>
<br/>
And that's why people like that story so much<br/>
<br/>
Because that's exactly right [like] we're the hobbits and there are we are<br/>
<br/>
Protected from Chaos by the spirits of our dead Ancestors, and we're too damn stupid to know it, and we think oh well<br/>
<br/>
We don't need them anymore and that to me that's post-Modernism<br/>
<br/>
That's what the bloody universities are doing with the humanities [to] absolutely appalling and we will pay for it<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
<br/>
Unless we wake up, and hopefully we'll wake up because that would be better than paying for it even [though] being awake as well<br/>
<br/>
[they're] painful<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
<br/>
so then I had this vision one time and I kind of portrayed it in this in this image of<br/>
<br/>
What the world was like and I thought well, it's not a pyramid<br/>
<br/>
It's not a single Hierarchy of authority that's not what it is<br/>
<br/>
It's it's an array of hierarchies of Authority so you imagine this sort of infinite plane and the the infinite plane<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing but pyramids and inside the pyramids there are strata of people<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere far as you can look some of the pyramids are tall some of them are short they overlap<br/>
<br/>
it's endless the [plain] is endless and those are all the positions to which you could rise and<br/>
<br/>
everybody's inside the pyramid sort of crammed up trying to move towards the top and then there's the possibility of sailing across over top of<br/>
<br/>
all [of] them and seeing how the structure itself works<br/>
<br/>
and that's and that's the eye that floats above the<br/>
<br/>
pyramid and it sees the<br/>
<br/>
structure itself and the highest order of being is [not] to be at the top of the pyramid it's to use the<br/>
<br/>
discipline that you attain by striving towards the top of the pyramid to release yourself from the pyramid and move one step up and<br/>
<br/>
That's I [think] that's one of the things that's instantiated in the idea of the for example of the holy ghost<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
<br/>
And I think that's akin to that that's sisyphus and needs a set of sisyphus if I remember correctly that one has to<br/>
<br/>
[Imagine] him happy well<br/>
<br/>
If there's a rock at the bottom of the Hill<br/>
<br/>
Then you might as well push it up the hill and if it rolls back [down] well<br/>
<br/>
then you've got something else to do don't you can push the damn rock back up the hill and there's no shortage of<br/>
<br/>
Rocks to put up to push up the hill and that's what we're built for anyways<br/>
<br/>
And so let's go out and like push some damn boulders up the hill and then maybe we could have enough self-confidence<br/>
<br/>
And enough enough respect for ourselves that we wouldn't have to turn to<br/>
<br/>
Hatred and revenge and try to take everything down because I think that's the alternative<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
<br/>
He's not weak. That's one thing you can say about him<br/>
<br/>
The same idea represented there right that's outlets who voluntarily takes the world on his shoulders<br/>
<br/>
It's like the idea of christ taking the sins of the world on his shoulders<br/>
<br/>
[it's] exactly the same notion which is the notion that you should be able to recognize in yourself all the horror of<br/>
<br/>
Humanity and take responsibility [for] it because that's what that means and the thing that's so interesting about that is that if you can recognize<br/>
<br/>
Yourself in yourself all the horror of humanity [you] [will] instantly have a hell of a lot more<br/>
<br/>
Respect for yourself than you did before you did that because there's some real utility and knowing that you're a monster<br/>
<br/>
Now on just because you're a monster doesn't mean you have to be a monster, [but] it's really useful to [know] that you are one<br/>
<br/>
so then and one of the things that Jung<br/>
<br/>
Knew and this is something that I find so [amazing] about his writing [is] I think something that really distinguishes him for example from Joseph<br/>
<br/>
Campbell who talked about following your bliss is like<br/>
<br/>
Jung said very clearly that the first step to enlightenment is the encounter with the shadow and what he meant by that was<br/>
<br/>
Everything horrible that human beings have done was [done] by human beings<br/>
<br/>
and you're one of them [and]<br/>
<br/>
So if you don't understand that and to understand that really means to know<br/>
<br/>
how it was that you could have done it and that's a shattering thing to try to imagine that to try to imagine yourself as<br/>
<br/>
Someone who's engaged in medieval torture to see how you could in fact do that<br/>
<br/>
You're never the same after you learn that but being never the same after learning that is<br/>
<br/>
Unbelievably useful because when you understand that that's what you're like, then you're a whole different creature<br/>
<br/>
And I don't think and this is something<br/>
<br/>
I did learn from jung is that you cannot be a good person until you know<br/>
<br/>
How much evil you contain within you it is not possible, and it's partly because you just don't have any potency<br/>
<br/>
like if you're just naive if you're just nice if you'd never hurt anyone you'd never hurt a fly you don't have the<br/>
<br/>
Capability [for] any of that, why would anyone ever take you seriously?<br/>
<br/>
You're you're just you're a domestic animal at best<br/>
<br/>
You know and a rather contemptible one at that?<br/>
<br/>
and it's a very strange thing because you wouldn't think that the revelation of the capacity for evil is a<br/>
<br/>
precondition [for] the realization of good<br/>
<br/>
But I believe first of all why [would] you be serious enough to even attempt [to] pursue the good?<br/>
<br/>
Unless you had some sense of what the consequence was of not doing it<br/>
<br/>
You have to be serious about these sorts of things. It's not it's not it's not the game of a child, right<br/>
<br/>
It's the game of [a] fully developed adult and you have learned this in part when I had little kids<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a chapter from my new book called never let your children do anything that makes you dislike them and<br/>
<br/>
Why was that and I read I read that wrote that after [I] knew I was a monster<br/>
<br/>
And I thought I'm going to make sure I [liked] my kids<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to make sure they behave around me so that I like them because I'm way bigger than them<br/>
<br/>
and I'm way more cruel than they are and I've got tricks up my sleeve that they cannot even possibly imagine [and] if if they<br/>
<br/>
Irritate me. [I]<br/>
<br/>
will absolutely<br/>
<br/>
Take it out on them, and if you don't think that you're the sort of person that would do that<br/>
<br/>
Then you are the sort of person [who] is doing it?<br/>
<br/>
you know<br/>
<br/>
We're not going to get to Adam and Eve ha ha<br/>
<br/>
Aria I watched this great documentary once<br/>
<br/>
Called Hitman hart and was about Bret hart and who was the most famous Canadian in the world for a while and he?<br/>
<br/>
was a worldwide wrestling federation wrestler you know and he was a good guy and<br/>
<br/>
He came from this famous family of wrestlers who all came from Alberta?<br/>
<br/>
I think there were seven brothers who were wrestlers and seven sisters and all the sisters married wrestlers, and they were all<br/>
<br/>
offspring children of Stu hart who<br/>
<br/>
Was a wrestling impresario like 40 years ago<br/>
<br/>
and it was it was such a cool documentary because I was always wondering why in the world did people watch wrestling and<br/>
<br/>
And then believe it you know believe it. Do you believe movies when you go watch them? It's like<br/>
<br/>
That's a hard question to answer while you're there you do and so if you're watching wrestling, and you're a wrestling fan<br/>
<br/>
Do you believe it? Well it is a matter of belief?<br/>
<br/>
It's a matter of being engaged in a drama and there are different levels of drama right so let's say worldwide wrestling<br/>
<br/>
Federation drama is not the most sophisticated form of drama, okay?<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not being a not being a smart aleck when I'm saying that<br/>
<br/>
There is drama of different sophistication for different people, and that's also why religious truths exist at multiple levels simultaneously<br/>
<br/>
Right it is got to [be] something in it for everyone, and that's a hard belief system<br/>
<br/>
that's a hard system to put together something for the<br/>
<br/>
Unbelievably sophisticated and something for the common person okay?<br/>
<br/>
So we have wrestling and bret hart was a good guy, and he fell into the archetype of being a good guy<br/>
<br/>
And that's partly what [the] what the story's about. It was a bit too much for him, but um<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that he he laid out<br/>
<br/>
So carefully where because he figured that 120 million people knew him something like that and that everywhere he went<br/>
<br/>
he was treated like a hero and he found out quite a bit of quite a burden as you could imagine if you think about<br/>
<br/>
It but he portrayed. What was happening in the wrestling ring as<br/>
<br/>
classic good against evil but not<br/>
<br/>
Conceptualized and discussed right embodied thought out acted out<br/>
<br/>
You know like like the like thor and the hulk except like right in front of you and so<br/>
<br/>
well<br/>
<br/>
That's exactly this sort of thing. I mean we could consider hockey more sophisticated than wrestling perhaps and<br/>
<br/>
As I said I'm not being a critic of these, I'm not being<br/>
<br/>
Critically minded about these things I understand their purpose, and I would highly recommend that documentary it's a brilliant documentary<br/>
<br/>
But this is it's the same thing. It's a silver cup right. It's like there's the hero of the team<br/>
<br/>
That's the hero of the team's you know here's something cool<br/>
<br/>
if you're the fan of the<br/>
<br/>
Toronto<br/>
<br/>
blue Jays are the Toronto maple leafs of course this hardly ever happens to you if you're the fan of the Toronto maple leafs because<br/>
<br/>
they always lose, but haha but but if<br/>
<br/>
You're watching a game and your team wins and we take your testosterone<br/>
<br/>
Levels then they went up<br/>
<br/>
And if you watch the Toronto maple leafs and they lost, and you're a fan then your testosterone levels go down<br/>
<br/>
So that's pretty damn funny. You know. I mean really don't you see how deeply instantiated. This is in people<br/>
<br/>
I mean it bloody well alters your biochemistry like your your your testosterone levels. It's all more my team loss<br/>
<br/>
You know it's like ah do. We know there'll be nothing in it for the wife tonight. You know<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Well, this is the cosmos I think from from the phenomenological perspective and one of the things that that that has come<br/>
<br/>
To my realization is that this is real?<br/>
<br/>
This is real. It's not a metaphor<br/>
<br/>
[it's] [way]</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">deeper than a metaphor the most real things about life are the place you don't know and the place you know and<br/>
<br/>
You could say well that's explored territory and unexplored territory that's real and it's been around forever back to the lobsters<br/>
<br/>
You know if you put lobsters in their new place the first thing<br/>
<br/>
They do is go around their territory finding places to hide and also making a burrow so the first thing<br/>
<br/>
They do is establish what they know?<br/>
<br/>
Against what they don't know and [that's] real it's real from the Darwinian perspective<br/>
<br/>
And we're going to say that what's real from the Darwinian perspective is plenty real enough because we're alive [and] everything and so that sort<br/>
<br/>
Of thing matters like well, that's what this is the taoist symbol. That's what it says. Is that what way it says?<br/>
<br/>
What is experience made of?<br/>
<br/>
Eternally that's easy<br/>
<br/>
Chaos and order and<br/>
<br/>
In every bit of Chaos. There's the possibility of order and in every bit of order<br/>
<br/>
There's the possibility of Chaos, and that's the way right. That's the path of life<br/>
<br/>
That's life itself and where you're supposed to be is right on the border between the two of those and why is that?<br/>
<br/>
stable enough<br/>
<br/>
Engaged enough, right?<br/>
<br/>
So not only are you doing what you should be doing you're doing [in] a way that increases the probability that you'll do it better<br/>
<br/>
tomorrow and you can tell when you're doing that because<br/>
<br/>
You're engaged you're in the right time and place and your your neurology tells you that that's what<br/>
<br/>
meaning is that's what transcendent meaning is and that's so cool because I also think [that] that is the antidote to<br/>
<br/>
Existential suffering the antidote to existential suffering is to be at the right place at the right time and you know?<br/>
<br/>
You want to get technical about it okay anxiety and pain?<br/>
<br/>
That's the cause that's the reality of the existential [so] suffering okay<br/>
<br/>
So let's say you're in the right place at the right time what happens to you, biochemically?<br/>
<br/>
Dopaminergic activation, what does that do?<br/>
<br/>
Suppresses anxiety and it's analgesic now<br/>
<br/>
it's more than that because also produces positive emotion and the desire [to] move forward and it underlies creativity and<br/>
<br/>
And so so not only do you get the positive engagement from a neurochemical?<br/>
<br/>
Perspective you get the analgesia and you get the anti end and you get the reduction of [anxiety] so it's not hypothetical<br/>
<br/>
It's and it is the case that the dopaminergic systems those are the exploratory systems unbelievably ancient and archaic are<br/>
<br/>
activated when you're optimally positioned to be<br/>
<br/>
To be what?<br/>
<br/>
Incorporating new information, which is what human beings do because we're information foragers, and so we want to be secure<br/>
<br/>
But building on [our] security at the same time and then we want to do it for ourselves<br/>
<br/>
We want to do it for other people we want to do it for our families<br/>
<br/>
We want to do it for broader Society we want to bring the whole world<br/>
<br/>
Together in alignment to do that, and that's meaningful<br/>
<br/>
And God only knows what we could do about the suffering of the world if we did that you know we have no idea<br/>
<br/>
What we could do if [we] started doing things properly and maybe so many of the things that dismay us about life<br/>
<br/>
We could we could stop<br/>
<br/>
I mean<br/>
<br/>
We stopped a lot of them in the last hundred years you [know] things are a lot better than they were a hundred years ago<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, they're not perfect, but [a] hundred years ago<br/>
<br/>
120 years ago man, you know the average person in the western world lived on less than a dollar a day in today's dollars<br/>
<br/>
It's like you just try that for a week and see how much fun that is<br/>
<br/>
so the daoists<br/>
<br/>
Well, what is this well?<br/>
<br/>
This is the pre cosmogonic Chaos out of which the [word] of [God] extracted habitable order at the beginning of time<br/>
<br/>
It's the same thing. It's the [same] thing and [that] Chaos<br/>
<br/>
We'll talk a bit more about [that] later<br/>
<br/>
I guess because it's a very complicated thing to to describe, but it's certainly the thing that when you encounter<br/>
<br/>
The Chaos is what you encounter when the twin towers fall?<br/>
<br/>
right you remember what that was [like] right, so<br/>
<br/>
It was it was september 10th. Well that was the world everyone knew what the world was like and then it was september 11th<br/>
<br/>
and everyone walked around day for three days because<br/>
<br/>
the [Building's] [failed]<br/>
<br/>
But so what you can see a building fall, you can understand what it's what happens when a building falls<br/>
<br/>
So then what's going on with the being dazed well?<br/>
<br/>
it's the Chaos that underlies our habitable order manifested itself in those buildings [collapse] was a Brilliant act of Terrorism and<br/>
<br/>
Everyone was frozen and curious because that's how we react to that sort of thing the it's like<br/>
<br/>
It's like the shark. You know remember that famous<br/>
<br/>
That famous movie poster for jaws with the woman swimming on the top of the water and that terrible<br/>
<br/>
Leviathan shark underneath coming up to to take her out. Well that's life man<br/>
<br/>
That's the world and now and then you see [that] [and] when something falls like the twin towers fall you<br/>
<br/>
remember that the Ocean below you the abyss right the primordial abyss that bloody thing is deep and<br/>
<br/>
Then you're fragile, and that happens when [someone] betrays you and it's happened<br/>
<br/>
It happens to you when your dreams fall apart you encounter that Chaos again from which the world is extracted<br/>
<br/>
And then you're called upon to act out<br/>
<br/>
attention and the word in order to bring the world back into order and none of that is<br/>
<br/>
none of that is<br/>
<br/>
Superstitious none of that is superstitious none of that's even metaphorical. It's real<br/>
<br/>
Its ribs more real than anything else, and I [think] the reason for that in part is that<br/>
<br/>
This has been it's been this way forever<br/>
<br/>
Right as long as there's been life<br/>
<br/>
this has been the rule of life and<br/>
<br/>
That's the cosmos that's reality. That's what we inhabit<br/>
<br/>
And so one of the things you know the the so-called new atheists<br/>
<br/>
And I they don't want to go on a tangent about new atheists because I think atheists are often remarkably honest and very<br/>
<br/>
consistent in their analysis, so<br/>
<br/>
But I just don't think they're taking the problem seriously that like I don't think they take their evolutionary<br/>
<br/>
theorizing nearly<br/>
<br/>
With the seriousness that it that it necessitates, and I don't think that I<br/>
<br/>
Don't think that you can dispute the proposition that the longer something has had a selection effect<br/>
<br/>
Life the more real it [is] it's the fundamental<br/>
<br/>
axiom of Darwinian biology<br/>
<br/>
And I think the Darwinian world is more real than the [physical] world that was the argument that I was trying to have with<br/>
<br/>
with Sam Harris, and I didn't do the world's best job with that although it went not too bad the second time, but it's<br/>
<br/>
It's not something to be taken lightly. [it's] a very<br/>
<br/>
serious Profound and meaningful<br/>
<br/>
proposition and<br/>
<br/>
People [act] [it] out and want to act it out whether they know it or not<br/>
<br/>
That's Marduk<br/>
<br/>
So the story of Marduk, I'll just give it to you very briefly<br/>
<br/>
Time at an apse who are locked in embrace at the beginning of time goddess of [saltwater]. God of freshwater?<br/>
<br/>
Together Chaos an order right they give rise<br/>
<br/>
Masculine feminine they give rise [to] the world of the elder gods and those are to me their primordial<br/>
<br/>
motivational forces or something like [that] and<br/>
<br/>
Their rage and their lust and their love and all these things that possess us that are there forever<br/>
<br/>
and they're out in the world acting and they carelessly slay absolu their father and<br/>
<br/>
they're making a racket and then they<br/>
<br/>
Collapse ooh and then time at<br/>
<br/>
gives wind of [that], and that's a [timeout] right there by the way she's kind of a rough looking creature and<br/>
<br/>
She's a mother of all things and so she's not very happy about this. They said though these her children have destroyed<br/>
<br/>
structure itself Plus<br/>
<br/>
They're noisy and Careless and so she thinks all right, just like Noah<br/>
<br/>
Just like the God that brings the flood to know what exactly the same idea time ad comes back<br/>
<br/>
It says yeah, okay enough is enough. I'm going to take you out and she makes this<br/>
<br/>
Battalion of monsters and puts the worst monster there is at the head of the Battalion. His name is King<br/>
<br/>
He's like a precursor to the idea of Satan and she lets the gods know hey<br/>
<br/>
I'm coming for you, and so they're not very happy about this because their gods, but like yeah<br/>
<br/>
She's Chaos itself right she gave birth to everything. This is no joke and so they send one<br/>
<br/>
God out after another to confront her and they all come [back] with the tails between their legs<br/>
<br/>
There's no hope and then one day<br/>
<br/>
There's a new God that emerges in that marduk and the gods know as soon as he pops up they know he's something new<br/>
<br/>
Remember and this is happening [while] the mesopotamians are assembling themselves into one of the world's first great<br/>
<br/>
Civilizations so all the gods of all those tribes are coming together to [organize] themselves into a hierarchy to figure out<br/>
<br/>
What proposition rules everything and so marduk is elected by all the gods and he says look I'll go out there<br/>
<br/>
And I'll take on time at but here's the rule from here on you follow me. I determine destiny<br/>
<br/>
I'm the top God I'm the [thing] at the top of the hierarchy and all the other gods say hey look no problem you get<br/>
<br/>
rid of Chaos<br/>
<br/>
We do exactly what you say now marduk. [he] [has] eyes all the way around his head and he speaks Magic words<br/>
<br/>
Those are his primary attributes<br/>
<br/>
and so he takes a net and he goes out to confront time out and and he he<br/>
<br/>
He encloses her in a net which<br/>
<br/>
I think is so cool because it's an encapsulation right? It's a conceptual encapsulation. He encloses Chaos itself in a conceptual structure<br/>
<br/>
he puts it in the net and then he cuts her into pieces and he makes the world and<br/>
<br/>
then<br/>
<br/>
Then he creates human beings to inhabit [that] world and to serve the gods<br/>
<br/>
and he creates human beings out of the blood of king of the worst of the demons and<br/>
<br/>
That took me to call into young as the student</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">might help me figure that out. I thought that's pretty damn pessimistic<br/>
<br/>
It's like you know what exactly it sounds like a fall metaphor. It's like the idea of original sin, but but our<br/>
<br/>
joint Conclusion<br/>
<br/>
With regards to that with it human beings are the only creatures in creation that can truly deceive<br/>
<br/>
Right we have the capacity for evil. Just like it says in the Adam and Eve story<br/>
<br/>
We can actually do that<br/>
<br/>
and that's why we're made out of the blood of king of the king of the demons the<br/>
<br/>
We are the thing that can deceive that can twist the structure of reality?<br/>
<br/>
well, so marduk now the mesopotamians had an emperor right and the emperor was the<br/>
<br/>
Avatar of Marduk that's what made him emperor. He was only at emperor<br/>
<br/>
if he was going to be marduk he had to be a good marduk which Mantia do confront time at Chaos and<br/>
<br/>
Cut her off and make or out of her pieces and what the method name is used to do at the New Year's celebration<br/>
<br/>
They go outside the walled city, and that's explored territory versus unexplored territory<br/>
<br/>
They go outside their walled city into [Chaos] and they bring all the statues that represented the gods<br/>
<br/>
And they'd act this out because they're trying to figure something out right you're trying to figure [out] what this means<br/>
<br/>
They're acting it out, and then they take their emperor and the priest would make them kneel, and [they'd] take all his king<br/>
<br/>
equally all his king uniform off his emperor uniform off and<br/>
<br/>
Make him kneel and humiliate him and nail him with a glove and say okay<br/>
<br/>
How were you not a good [marduk] this year right? And then he'd recount all the ways that he was inadequate in<br/>
<br/>
confronting Chaos, and then they do the celebration and marduk would win and and the king would go sleep with a royal prostitute and and<br/>
<br/>
The reason for that was it's the same [idea] st.. George pulling the virgin from the dragon<br/>
<br/>
it's exactly the same idea that if you call if you encounter the<br/>
<br/>
Reptilian Chaos you can extract something out of it with which if you unite, you produce creative order<br/>
<br/>
That's what they were acting out, and that was the basis for the mesopotamian idea of sovereignty. It's so smart<br/>
<br/>
it's so unbelievably smart and you know the mesopotamians had a massive influence on the<br/>
<br/>
civilizations that then had a massive influence on assets one of the stories of how the notion of sovereignty itself came to be it's the<br/>
<br/>
Evolution of the idea of God that's one way of thinking about it<br/>
<br/>
But even more importantly it's the evolution of the idea of the redemptive human being right?<br/>
<br/>
And that's taken - it's one of its conclusions following the story of buddha<br/>
<br/>
But also in the story of christ the idea of the perfect individual and the notion is well<br/>
<br/>
That's the word that speaks truth into Chaos at the beginning of time to generate habitable order that is good<br/>
<br/>
That's the story and so with that<br/>
<br/>
Let's See oh<br/>
<br/>
Sure, I'll just show you these [pictures] because they're so interesting once you know what they mean, they're so cool. That's a symbol of infinity<br/>
<br/>
[let's] Hercules and Hydra. What's life like cut off one head what happens?<br/>
<br/>
Seven more grow right, what do you do run hold well? No, that's not what you do it<br/>
<br/>
This is what you do you fight it<br/>
<br/>
It's the it's the Chaos that generates<br/>
<br/>
Partial Chaos, it's the ultimate Chaos that generates partial Chaos<br/>
<br/>
But that Chaos also is what Revista finds life because otherwise it would just be static<br/>
<br/>
Mercury<br/>
<br/>
The head of the Hydra right freeze of you, I'd [saint] George. He's doing it peacefully which is so interesting right?<br/>
<br/>
He's got a beatific look on his face in that particular representation another [Saint] George right the virgin in the background<br/>
<br/>
I think that's say dan if I remember correctly<br/>
<br/>
St.. George is the Patron Saint of England<br/>
<br/>
Here's an interesting one this actually sheds light on on the human proclivity for Warfare St.. George<br/>
<br/>
That's a Muslim soldier<br/>
<br/>
It's really easy to transform the enemy into the dragon right because the enemy is often the predator and we do that instantaneously<br/>
<br/>
Right without a second thought and so then we can go to war morally because why not take out the snakes?<br/>
<br/>
well, you know the problem is where are the snakes or maybe they're outside and maybe they're not maybe they're in this room and even<br/>
<br/>
Worse maybe they're in you and that's wisdom when you know that they're  in you.<br/>
<br/>
Why wouldn't she be happy about that especially [if] she had a especially if she had a child right seriously?<br/>
<br/>
and that's [horace] right the god of vision and he was a<br/>
<br/>
He was a falken because Falcons have great vision and they fly above everything and they can see everything so that was the egyptian created<br/>
<br/>
God horus, and I'll tell you the story about horus at some points well<br/>
<br/>
Now here are some pictures that demonstrate what I had<br/>
<br/>
Described as the emergence of let's say the meta hero out of the hero<br/>
<br/>
So there's the person you [admire], and then there's the set of people that you admire<br/>
<br/>
[and] then there's the meta set of admirable people and the extraction of that ideal as far as I can tell that's just what's portrayed<br/>
<br/>
in these images<br/>
<br/>
That's a great one. It's very sophisticated image you see that the two sides of Christ's face are not<br/>
<br/>
symmetrical<br/>
<br/>
One is God in ones man. That's what that icon means and so the fully developed person in this representation. [it's] one of the oldest<br/>
<br/>
representations of this sort that we know the idea is that<br/>
<br/>
There's a there's a human person<br/>
<br/>
In his ordinariness let's say, and then there's this this kinship with the divine that's associated with the willing<br/>
<br/>
adoption of the responsibilities of Moral Mortal being and that produces this union<br/>
<br/>
And then it's manifest in a book right because that's speech, and it's associated with the son right it's the proper way of being<br/>
<br/>
And that's a perfect example. I think of the emergence of the archetype out of the multitude. That's what it looks like to me<br/>
<br/>
and so I guess now we're done with Genesis one and took three lectures, but<br/>
<br/>
[God's] complicated you know, that's the thing<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
<br/>
so thank you and<br/>
<br/>
Next week by all appearances. That's where we are so we've got<br/>
<br/>
20 minutes for questions<br/>
<br/>
So in the past I've done some work with blog big brother big sister and whatever<br/>
<br/>
[that] being said that the most common story I tend to hear from pacific youth is that they write they're raised in a single family<br/>
<br/>
Home usually [with] a mom daddy's there on a picture in alcoholic, whatever whatever the writer<br/>
<br/>
So we have this child who is trying to?<br/>
<br/>
Seek ways to make himself healthy and Empower himself in a ways that a healthy father should have done<br/>
<br/>
So you know between the formative years [of] like 1 to 4 so I think you know I'm going with this<br/>
<br/>
How let's say for someone who born without like a good father figure where would they go out in the world or like what?<br/>
<br/>
for series of incidents where they try to expose themselves to to like<br/>
<br/>
gain access to that<br/>
<br/>
balancing of health and<br/>
<br/>
Knowledge that a father though a good father figure should have provided to in the first place<br/>
<br/>
[ok] well partly<br/>
<br/>
I mean certainly to some degree a good mother can provide that right to some degree although<br/>
<br/>
it's hard for one person to be everything right you know and I think one of the conundrums that face women and this is [a]<br/>
<br/>
Tough one and this is why I think women are higher in trade agreeableness and higher and trade negative emotion<br/>
<br/>
Is that you know the primary?<br/>
<br/>
Problem that a woman has with an infant is why not throw it out a window because it's very annoying right?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it's there all the [time]. It's constant demand<br/>
<br/>
It's absolutely constant amount tremendous dependency and so a woman has to be tilted Towards Mercy<br/>
<br/>
That's how it looks to me<br/>
<br/>
Right and especially during it's so important during the especially the first year when children are so unbelievably vulnerable<br/>
<br/>
And so I think it's very difficult for women to be merciful like that and to make the shift to encouraging<br/>
<br/>
Disciplinarian I think that's a very difficult thing for people to do<br/>
<br/>
simultaneously although<br/>
<br/>
You know people people. I'm not saying that women are always only merciful and men are always only encouraging disciplinarians<br/>
<br/>
But things do sort themselves out to some degree [like] that, and I think also the biochemical transformations<br/>
<br/>
That accompany pregnancy and childbirth and lactation also tilt a mother towards that as well<br/>
<br/>
We have to really love that little thing right it's it's number one<br/>
<br/>
No matter what it demands, and then telling it what to do and making sure it's behaving properly<br/>
<br/>
That's that's a whole [different] issue now, but the kids who Lack fathers. I mean<br/>
<br/>
first of all they can find that to some [degree] in their friends<br/>
<br/>
And that's often what father boys do in particular they go into gangs and they generate the missing men<br/>
<br/>
Masculinity in the game well that's not so good because like what the hell do they know<br/>
<br/>
Well, they don't know anything, right?<br/>
<br/>
They're just stupid kids<br/>
<br/>
And they're like [fifteen] years old and the testosterone is pumping and they're trying to get the hell [away] from their mother<br/>
<br/>
Which is what they're supposed [to] do and and they're not in the right position [to] exercise any authority over themselves<br/>
<br/>
So that's that's not good. They can find it in education. They can find it in books they can find it in movies<br/>
<br/>
They can find it in sports heroes and so forth because the image of the father is fragmented and distributed among the community<br/>
<br/>
But it's very very difficult<br/>
<br/>
To not have a father<br/>
<br/>
[right] and you know one [of] the things that we're doing in our society which I think is I think it's absolutely<br/>
<br/>
Appalling is that we're making the case that all families are equal. It's like sorry no wrong<br/>
<br/>
Then there's no empirical data supporting that proposition by the way<br/>
<br/>
It's much better for kids to have two parents know who those parents are that's a whole different issue, okay?<br/>
<br/>
and if</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">I could just<br/>
<br/>
[add] one [more] thing of how would you ask that question so let's see a daughter [was] raised not a father because [she] would all<br/>
<br/>
See have different ways to find those fragments of her missing [father] than like a boy would instead because obviously they're raised differently at least<br/>
<br/>
They should have been well. I think it's the same issue. You know. I mean. I think that another danger that emerges Mrs.<br/>
<br/>
Freud's of course famous observation is that you know if there's mom and child were father and child that<br/>
<br/>
relationship can get a little closer than it should and<br/>
<br/>
Then the lines get blurry and mixed and I'm not saying that that happens to everyone<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, but but it's still a danger that that's inherent in the situation<br/>
<br/>
They're thrust together too tightly without<br/>
<br/>
sufficient resources<br/>
<br/>
and so the responsibility has to be distributed more and like I really do think that it's the sign of the degeneration of the<br/>
<br/>
Society when that when when single parenthood becomes anything approximating the norm it's not a good idea<br/>
<br/>
then the and part of the reason I believe that and I [think] this has to do with the<br/>
<br/>
overwhelming selfishness of<br/>
<br/>
Modern life is that marriage isn't for the people who are married<br/>
<br/>
It's for the children [obviously] [and] like if you can't handle that grow the hell up see right now. I mean seriously yeah seriously<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
<br/>
Once you once you have kids it is not about you<br/>
<br/>
period Now that doesn't mean it isn't about you at all but<br/>
<br/>
That just seems so self-evident to me. I can't believe that anybody would even would even question it. Oh, it's [dino] larson<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes, well, I'm certainly aware of that yes. It's questioned. It's almost illegal to question it now you know [to] to or<br/>
<br/>
illegal to make the set of propositions [that] I'm making so<br/>
<br/>
That's the best. I can do guys excellent. Thank you<br/>
<br/>
The question is going in part two the first part of first up here lecture, but it's also something that's been on my mind<br/>
<br/>
Listening to your lectures over the past few months, and that's when we talk about<br/>
<br/>
the<br/>
<br/>
Psychological truth or significance of the Bible to what extent does that psychological psychological truth has to be embodied in specific?<br/>
<br/>
Historical events or people and so for instance the thing that sort of been bugging on my mind<br/>
<br/>
There's there's a part that st.. Paul is talking about in the new testament somewhere<br/>
<br/>
In one of his letters, and he's talking to the resurrection, and he says if it didn't happen<br/>
<br/>
Then if this whole thing just means the [faith] is meaningless like for him there had to be that<br/>
<br/>
Embodiment of that his capital. Yes<br/>
<br/>
The nor event in that case<br/>
<br/>
Well the best answer I have to that at the moment is that I'm really happy that I'm not at that point yet in this<br/>
<br/>
lecture series<br/>
<br/>
you know because because that there's a there's a crucial issue there, and I don't know exactly what to make of it and<br/>
<br/>
My approach at the moment as I said is to approach this as rationally as I possibly can and I hope I know a hell<br/>
<br/>
of a lot more about what I'm doing by the time I get to that particular [question] [and]<br/>
<br/>
I do have<br/>
<br/>
The beginnings of ways to answer that but I'm not going to answer that at all right now because it's so bloody complicated that would<br/>
<br/>
Just burn me to a frazzle and I'm already mostly bird to a frazzle after that lecture, so I<br/>
<br/>
Couldn't attempt to even start to sketch it out<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. [I] mean part of it is to be just rational about it just to be rational about it<br/>
<br/>
There is something about the idea that continual death and rebirth is a necessary precondition to proper human adaptation<br/>
<br/>
every time you learn something new that's important part of the stupid old you [has] to die and<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that can be an awful lot of you and in fact it can be so much of you sometimes that you just die<br/>
<br/>
Right you just can't handle it<br/>
<br/>
And so there is there is a real idea that you have to identify with the part of [yourself] that<br/>
<br/>
Transcends [your] current personality that can constantly die and be reborn<br/>
<br/>
Now then I could say well that means that all of this is psychological and symbolic, and that's the simplest answer<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not satisfied with that answer even though<br/>
<br/>
I think it's coherent and complete because the [world] [is] a very weird place and there are things about it that we don't understand so<br/>
<br/>
so I can't go I can't go any farther than that at the moment, so<br/>
<br/>
Yeah<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Dr.. Peterson. I just recently watched<br/>
<br/>
One of your videos of you debating with transgendered protesters at uoft<br/>
<br/>
free speech Rally in October and<br/>
<br/>
one of the<br/>
<br/>
Protesters one of the comments one of the protesters said to you which [isn't] particularly very like very chilling was<br/>
<br/>
Why do you have the right to determine whether an individual is worthy of you using their pronouns?<br/>
<br/>
The scary thing to me is how common this type [of] view is among Radical Left-Wing?<br/>
<br/>
[protesters] on University campuses who feel they have the right to tell other people<br/>
<br/>
What they [can] think what words they can use and what speakers they can or cannot listen to?<br/>
<br/>
The even scarier part is that our government is creating legislations to back up their ADl?<br/>
<br/>
ideologies<br/>
<br/>
which is evident through [Bill] C16<br/>
<br/>
M103 and Bill 89<br/>
<br/>
So my question is what do you think the [endgame] is in all this because it seems?<br/>
<br/>
Every year or we're in the process of finding that out?<br/>
<br/>
You know and I'm sorry. I'm sorry<br/>
<br/>
Okay, we're in [the] [process] of finding that out<br/>
<br/>
I don't I mean I think the endgame that underlies all of that in my estimation<br/>
<br/>
Is best summed up by jacques?<br/>
<br/>
Derrida's [Christiane] [her] criticism [of] western Civilization its Fal logo centric now<br/>
<br/>
We've already talked about what the logos means<br/>
<br/>
Right and so and and so for for Derrida that was a sign of its utter<br/>
<br/>
What would you call it utter despit the dot early despicable dominant nature of Western Culture<br/>
<br/>
Well that that's what animates the post modernists now. They may not know that because<br/>
<br/>
an Indie ology gets fragmented<br/>
<br/>
across its Adherents<br/>
<br/>
And then it only acts as the coherent ideology with all those adherents come together in a mob and then you see the animating spirit<br/>
<br/>
So I<br/>
<br/>
Said I think that there's a battle going on. That's a battle exactly at the level that Derrida<br/>
<br/>
Described and that's a theological battle with a philosophical<br/>
<br/>
With it with the philosophical implications<br/>
<br/>
And out of those philosophical implications come political implications, but it's not primarily political and it's not primarily philosophical<br/>
<br/>
It's deeper than that and the post modernists are out<br/>
<br/>
There their criticism was designed to be<br/>
<br/>
Fundamental and it also emerged out of Marxism and let's not forget that the Marxist Criticism was not only fundamental<br/>
<br/>
But just about resulted in the nuclear annihilation of the [girl] these are not trivial issues, and we're back in the same<br/>
<br/>
Insane boat and so what do I think should be done about that well?<br/>
<br/>
I thought about that way before any of this happened, and I think that what?<br/>
<br/>
We [should] do about it is we [should] tell the truth<br/>
<br/>
Because there isn't anything more powerful than that<br/>
<br/>
And that's the right theological answer because the spoken truth brings good into being<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's the [Fal] logo centric idea<br/>
<br/>
And I'm trying to revisit that to explain to people what it means and to see if they think that's a good idea. [I] mean<br/>
<br/>
that's what we have to figure out is it is that an idea worth adhering to or not the alternative [is] the<br/>
<br/>
[C4] the post Modernists the world is that landscape of pyramids that I described, but there's no<br/>
<br/>
Transcendent vision that's over above that and all of those pyramids are equally valid and it's a war [of] everyone against everyone<br/>
<br/>
It's like it's like the nightmare of hobbes thomas hobbes except that it's not individuals. It's groups and everyone's that group<br/>
<br/>
You're a group. [you're] whatever your group is it's like that's death as far as I'm concerned<br/>
<br/>
it's it's it's utterly reprehensible and<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
We better sort it out because if we don't sort it out. We are bloody well going to pay for it, so<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
<br/>
Hey, how's it going? I just want to say thank you for doing all this and I really appreciate that's Bob and doug mcKenzie<br/>
<br/>
Right yeah, hey how's it going? Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you caught that yeah yeah, yeah, well I did a Facebook poll<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, people who are familiar with where your work and a question kind of rose to the top like just?<br/>
<br/>
Right out of their lives<br/>
<br/>
Spectacular and what it was you didn't really touch it here, but you touched it a bit in your lectures<br/>
<br/>
It was about integrating the shadow yep, and one of [the] main questions was how does one<br/>
<br/>
Go about that, especially in the Modern world. You know like<br/>
<br/>
Really sheltered from anything resembling that kind of concept you know we don't engage like the unknown we don't<br/>
<br/>
Come into life-or-death situations most of us [must] [rework] is like an ambulance. [you] know<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's one thing you can do with that is one thing you can do. You know well?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you can search out experiences that put you there<br/>
<br/>
That's that's that's you know because well, you can do that as a volunteer for example<br/>
<br/>
I mean, you can one of the things I saw once<br/>
<br/>
[Within] montreal I was in this outdoor mall in Montreal on St.. Hubert and<br/>
<br/>
saw this great big 17 year old kid you know and<br/>
<br/>
He had a mohawk and he was dressed in leather<br/>
<br/>
And he with you know studs and like he was he was<br/>
<br/>
He was doing the water and Barbarian thing and he had it really down<br/>
<br/>
And [you] know he's standing on the corner with two pink shopping bags<br/>
<br/>
Hey, because look into him<br/>
<br/>
And I thought you know if someone offered him the ID<br/>
<br/>
The opportunity to drop those goddamn sleeping bags or shopping bags and go fight with isis<br/>
<br/>
He'd be there in a second<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, right, because what the hell is some monster like that doing standing on the corner of St.. Hubert alden [-] pink shopping bags<br/>
<br/>
So I mean so some of it is</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">that it you need you need to find out where you can push where you could you?<br/>
<br/>
Can need to find out that edge that you can push yourself against the tree<br/>
<br/>
It's going to be different for different people<br/>
<br/>
But there's there's that's the call to adventure and heroism<br/>
<br/>
And there are life and death situations everywhere around you if you want to involve yourself in them<br/>
<br/>
you know<br/>
<br/>
an idiot sometimes that might be<br/>
<br/>
like to put yourself together to the degree that you can say physically or spiritually or intellectually it could be an<br/>
<br/>
intellectual Battle it could be a Moral battle like the<br/>
<br/>
Frontier is everywhere<br/>
<br/>
the Frontier is just the Edge between what you know and what you don't know you want to put yourself on that damn edge and<br/>
<br/>
Then make yourself into something and and you can retreat into comfort in the modern world, and I think that is a problem<br/>
<br/>
You know I mean I've noticed that<br/>
<br/>
It's one of the pathologies of wealth I would say because one of the problems with [being]<br/>
<br/>
Relatively wealthy if you're a parent<br/>
<br/>
is that you cannot provide your children with necessity, and that's a big problem, because they need necessity to call them into being and<br/>
<br/>
You know if you don't have a lot of material resources and your children ask you for something you?<br/>
<br/>
Can say no because no is the [answer] it's like<br/>
<br/>
No, you can't do that, but if you can say yes, then it's really hard to say no because then you're just arbitrary well<br/>
<br/>
I don't know<br/>
<br/>
it's like<br/>
<br/>
Kierkegaard said you know there will come a time when we have so much security and comfort that what we'll want more than anything else<br/>
<br/>
is part<br/>
<br/>
deprivation and challenge, and I think I think that's<br/>
<br/>
particularly, what young men want<br/>
<br/>
Now I think that that's partly because young women<br/>
<br/>
they're stuck with that anyways because they have to it's it's it's the necessity of living in the world and<br/>
<br/>
The responsibility of infant care in particular [like] that occupies them men have to do it voluntarily<br/>
<br/>
Women now - because of the birth control pill, but you know that's [what] thirty years ago<br/>
<br/>
We hardly have to talk [about] that at all yes, so<br/>
<br/>
Then you have so much<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Dr.. Peterson, so I'm actually a coptic orthodox and egyptian, so I found [you're] [talking] [a] incredibly interesting<br/>
<br/>
I've also taken a deep interest in the old church fathers and as if you're talking about Iraqis I [arkin] back to St.<br/>
<br/>
Athanasius when the idea feels is that you brought up last time that God became man so that man can become like God<br/>
<br/>
So I was thinking about the systems of the hierarchies and is that an example [of] at the top of the pyramid the Hierarchy?<br/>
<br/>
sort of gets inverted or<br/>
<br/>
descends to the bottom and brings it up and to the top and that sort of an attraction to of Christianity that sort of<br/>
<br/>
Made Christianity such a powerful idea. What are your thoughts on that? Oh?<br/>
<br/>
well, it's certainly one [of] the I mean it's certainly one of the things that we not just Christianity a powerful idea because one of<br/>
<br/>
the things that happened this was called the democratization of<br/>
<br/>
Osiris if I remember correctly and like what happened see if I can answer this question<br/>
<br/>
Using this approach for sex is that going to work?<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I<br/>
<br/>
don't know if I can answer that [question] that way the the<br/>
<br/>
part of the attraction of<br/>
<br/>
Christianity, but this was something that emerged across time was the notion that even if you were in a lowly position that there was something<br/>
<br/>
About you that was akin to the divine and now you might say well, that's just wish fulfillment<br/>
<br/>
That's what freud would say that's what Marx would say right the opiate of the masses<br/>
<br/>
Tweeted yesterday something. I thought was pretty funny which was that<br/>
<br/>
like religion was the opiate of the masses<br/>
<br/>
but that marxism was the methamphetamine of the max of the masses, so<br/>
<br/>
So so I think the attraction was that it it [it]<br/>
<br/>
Allowed people to recognize their intrinsic dignity and one of the things I've been thinking about is the juxtaposition<br/>
<br/>
Between Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 because what I was in genesis 2 is that human beings collapse and fall?<br/>
<br/>
right and then were these fallen creatures that no evil, but in the beginning in Genesis 1<br/>
<br/>
It's really [an] optimistic story because it says well<br/>
<br/>
we're the sorts of creatures that partake in the calling forth of being from Chaos and<br/>
<br/>
Then that's in our essential nature and to some degree if you juxtapose both of those it's as if that's the entire biblical story<br/>
<br/>
rammed Together in the first two chapters<br/>
<br/>
Which is partly why we're taking so long to get through this by the way is that<br/>
<br/>
to return to genesis 1 is the antidote to genesis 2 it's like to continue to Act out the<br/>
<br/>
Doctrine that you're made in God's image<br/>
<br/>
And that means that you're you're capable of speaking good being into existence through truth<br/>
<br/>
And that that's also the antidote to the fall which I think is actually the fundamental<br/>
<br/>
narrative message of the entire Biblical structure, and I also think of [western] civilization for that matter, so<br/>
<br/>
There's a nobility and this is also<br/>
<br/>
I think Nietzsche was fundamentally wrong in his [criticism] with Christianity because he thought about it and slaves morality you know the<br/>
<br/>
vengeance of the bottom against the talk<br/>
<br/>
That's more historical than theological so it gives dignity it<br/>
<br/>
illuminates the dignity [of] the human being and<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
Requires responsibility so it's not just wish fulfillment<br/>
<br/>
It's not freudian wish fulfillment the freudian theory which I thought about a lot is<br/>
<br/>
Not tenable in my estimation it also doesn't account for the [existence] of hell because if it's only wish fulfillment, why bother with hell<br/>
<br/>
It means a lot more<br/>
<br/>
If you're really going to just fulfill a wish it's like everybody gets to go to Heaven no matter what they do<br/>
<br/>
You don't have hell which was of course something absolutely terrifying to medieval Christians and then to plenty of people now for that matter<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
<br/>
It's the nobility it's the idea of the nobility that I thinks deeply attractive to people, and that's all there is I mean<br/>
<br/>
What you have to fight against your worm-like?<br/>
<br/>
Fragile Mortal existence is the possibility of<br/>
<br/>
Transcending that with nobility of speech and act. That's what you have and who can hear that without feeling<br/>
<br/>
Ennoble by that now you might say well you might shudder and say well, I don't I can't bear the responsibility<br/>
<br/>
[it's] like well fair enough, man. You know I mean that that's a reasonable criticism, but the consequence of not bearing the [responsibility] is<br/>
<br/>
That's hell really so thank you<br/>
<br/>
And thank you very much beautiful um I don't know feel familiar with the words of Nasan Talib<br/>
<br/>
I'm reasonably familiar with them, so I think it's sad [to] say that he has<br/>
<br/>
He talked about the idea that<br/>
<br/>
People and especially modern people have a failure to recognize<br/>
<br/>
the Unknown Unknowns<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, such yes, right. That's a good way of thinking about it<br/>
<br/>
Can you move the mic up a bit so that people can hear you a little better? Thanks gary. Yes um<br/>
<br/>
Well, I was wondering do you think that that failure might?<br/>
<br/>
Might be in some way related to the way that modern people<br/>
<br/>
fail [to] relate to the idea of God so in the sense that<br/>
<br/>
your people can't<br/>
<br/>
Really grapple with the notion of God<br/>
<br/>
I think as much as you can give a rational [argument] or you can't feel God in the way that perhaps a more religious person<br/>
<br/>
or more<br/>
<br/>
[an] older person might have<br/>
<br/>
Felt God do you think that that inability to?<br/>
<br/>
recognize<br/>
<br/>
the Unknown Unknowns might play into<br/>
<br/>
That yeah, well they're okay so that seems to be related to this idea of the absence of necessity<br/>
<br/>
That's something like that. Is that no because I think that I think that what you're you're making a claim?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe tell me if I've got it wrong that if you're sheltered too much<br/>
<br/>
Then it also<br/>
<br/>
It also separates you from anything that's divine<br/>
<br/>
[I] guess that might be right because there's not enough intensity of the experience and something like that<br/>
<br/>
is that is that part of the is that part of the issue it might be more related [to] the idea of<br/>
<br/>
like<br/>
<br/>
realizing the absolute infinite root of what you don't know like the like the mysterium tremendum that that kind of<br/>
<br/>
You know if you believe that through statistical analysis you can get everything under control and you genuinely believe that at some point<br/>
<br/>
You'll get it or wonder you know. Yeah, okay? Well, so okay, so so well, that's also<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the danger of<br/>
<br/>
Rationality that the Catholics have been implicitly warning again forever<br/>
<br/>
Is that rather rational mind tends to fall in love with its own productions and then to worship them as absolutes?<br/>
<br/>
Which is I think what [Melville] was trying to represent?<br/>
<br/>
by his Satanic figure in Paradise lost [I] think about as like a precursor a prophetic precursor to the emergence of<br/>
<br/>
Totalitarian states in the Modern world and so yeah, I think that you can believe that<br/>
<br/>
What you know is?<br/>
<br/>
Sufficient to Banish permanently what you don't know and I do think that that does<br/>
<br/>
Paradoxically although you think that that would make you secure it also does destroy your relationship with with with with<br/>
<br/>
With the spirit that might help you deal [with] what it [is] that you really don't know with the unknown unknowns, so [yeah]<br/>
<br/>
I mean, we don't know to what degree extreme experience is necessary<br/>
<br/>
to bring Forth extreme<br/>
<br/>
Experience right what do you have to be through before you encounter a religious revelation?<br/>
<br/>
Well people might say well, you can't because there's no such thing. It's like well. Don't be so sure about that<br/>
<br/>
I mean people have reported them [to] row history, but they don't generally occur when your that's my favorite tropen<br/>
<br/>
You're eating [cheesie's] [and] playing you know and playing Mario brothers, right?<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, so that's the best I can do with that engine yes. Yeah<br/>
<br/>
This has to be the last question [all] right<br/>
<br/>
I'll make it quick yeah earlier when you talked about<br/>
<br/>
Criminality and creativity</span></font>
 <font face="Courier New, monospace"><span lang="en-US">trends in that in men peaking at 14 it reminded me of something. You said, I think it was Joe Rogan<br/>
<br/>
[talking] about Sjw's and<br/>
<br/>
Kind of and how they create their own Chaos talking about how adolescents have this drive to change the world<br/>
<br/>
And I was wondering if if those three the criminality creativity drive to change the world are<br/>
<br/>
linked and if so if they manifest differently in men and women<br/>
<br/>
And if they [kind] of come from the same, era well, I think they are linked<br/>
<br/>
But I'm going to concentrate more on the net second part of your question<br/>
<br/>
So I'm going to ask you two guys some think about something, so I talked to a friend of mine the other day<br/>
<br/>
He's a very very smart guy and we've been talking about<br/>
<br/>
While all the sorts of things that we've been [talking] about tonight for a long time and we were talking about the relatively<br/>
<br/>
relative evolutionary roles of men and women this is speculative obviously and and<br/>
<br/>
Because our research did indicate it's tentative research so far that that the the sgs<br/>
<br/>
Sjw Sort of equality above all else Philosophy is more prevalent among women<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's predicted by the personality factors that are more common among women so agreeable this and high negative emotion<br/>
<br/>
primarily agreeableness, but in addition<br/>
<br/>
It's also predicted by being female<br/>
<br/>
And that's interesting because in most of the personality research that I've done and as far as I know in the literature at<br/>
<br/>
you know in more broadly speaking most of the time you can get rid of the<br/>
<br/>
attitudinal differences between men and women or at least reduce them [by] controlling for personality<br/>
<br/>
so if you take a feminine man, and a masculine woman then you know that the [polls]<br/>
<br/>
reverse but that didn't seem to be the case with political correctness, and so I've been thinking about that a lot because<br/>
<br/>
well men [are] bailing out of the humanities like mad and<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much out of the universities except for stem the women are moving in like mad<br/>
<br/>
And they're also moving into the political sphere like math<br/>
<br/>
And this is new right we've never had this happen before and we do know [no]<br/>
<br/>
do not know what the significance of it is it's only 50 years old and<br/>
<br/>
So we were thinking about this and so, I don't know what you think about this proposition, but imagine that that historically speaking<br/>
<br/>
it's something like<br/>
<br/>
Women were responsible for distribution and men were responsible for production<br/>
<br/>
Something like that, and maybe maybe that's only the case really in the tight confines of the immediate family<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn't matter because that's most of the evolutionary landscape for human beings anyways<br/>
<br/>
What the women does it did was make sure that everybody got enough?<br/>
<br/>
okay, and that seems to me to be one of the things that's driving at least in part the Sjw demand for for equity and<br/>
<br/>
Equality it's like let's make sure everybody [has] enough. It's like both look fair enough<br/>
<br/>
You know I mean you can't you can't argue with that<br/>
<br/>
But there's there's an antipathy between that and the [the] reality of differential productivity<br/>
<br/>
[you] know because people really do differ in their productivity, so<br/>
<br/>
All right, so to answer your question fully. I do think that the rebellious tendency of adolescence is<br/>
<br/>
Associated both with that criminality spike, especially among men and with creativity. Yes<br/>
<br/>
I think that the sJw phenomena is different<br/>
<br/>
and I think it is associated at least in part with the rise of women to political power and and<br/>
<br/>
We don't know what women are life when they have political power because they've never had it<br/>
<br/>
I mean<br/>
<br/>
There's been [queens] obviously and that sort of thing [just] being female authority figures and females have<br/>
<br/>
Wielded far more power historically than feminists generally like to admit<br/>
<br/>
But this is a different thing and we don't know what [a] truly female political philosophy would be like but it might be<br/>
<br/>
Especially if it's not been well examined and it isn't very sophisticated conceptually it could easily be well<br/>
<br/>
Let's make sure things are distributed equally well yeah<br/>
<br/>
But sorry that's that's just not going to do you fly do you think in terms of the rest of this?<br/>
<br/>
Jw's and you talked about last lecture as well creating Chaos when there is none otherwise. It'd be static<br/>
<br/>
Do you think there would be any validity in saying that in a country [like] Canada were pretty gender equal is<br/>
<br/>
There any merit to thinking Sjw's are trying to create Chaos<br/>
<br/>
Even when they're arguably is none on the mass level obviously there's still problems<br/>
<br/>
Why would they do that otherwise it would be static and that well doesn't if it wouldn't for them<br/>
<br/>
So I read this I read this quote once and I don't remember who<br/>
<br/>
Who said it it might have been robert heinlein for crying out loud science fiction author that Springs to mind<br/>
<br/>
But a problem it probably wasn't<br/>
<br/>
And his the proposition was that men tested ideas and that women tested men, and I kind of like that<br/>
<br/>
There's something about that. You know and now it obviously it's an [over] [generalization], but we also don't know to what degree<br/>
<br/>
women test men Cheerilee through<br/>
<br/>
Provocation it's a lot because like if you want to test someone you don't have a like little<br/>
<br/>
Conversation [with] them like you [poke] the hell out of them<br/>
<br/>
And you say okay like I'm going to let go after you and see where your weak spots are and it seems to me that<br/>
<br/>
This it seems to me that in this constant<br/>
<br/>
protest and use of shame and all of that that goes along with this with this sort of radical movement towards egalitarianism that there's a<br/>
<br/>
Tremendous amount of provocation and<br/>
<br/>
God, I'm going to say this too even though<br/>
<br/>
I shouldn't but it but we mean how I don't believe this, but I'm trying trying to figure it out<br/>
<br/>
You know I thought it was absolutely<br/>
<br/>
Comical when [fifty] [Shades] of [Grey] came out a not just I [just] thought that was just so insanely comical that at the same time<br/>
<br/>
there's this massive political demand for like radical equality and and<br/>
<br/>
And say with regards to sexual behavior and the fastest-selling novel the world had ever seen<br/>
<br/>
Was S&amp;M domination right? It's like. Oh, well. We know where the unconscious is going with that one don't leave and<br/>
<br/>
and sometimes I think like because one of the things that I've really tried to puzzle out and<br/>
<br/>
It's not like I believe this right<br/>
<br/>
I'm just telling you what I wear the edges of my thinking of being going is that you have this crazy<br/>
<br/>
Alliance between the feminists and the radical islamist that I just do not get it's like the [feminists]<br/>
<br/>
[it's] like why they aren't protesting non-stop about Saudi<br/>
<br/>
Arabia is just<br/>
<br/>
Completely Beyond me<br/>
<br/>
like I do not<br/>
<br/>
Understand it in the least and I wonder - I just wonder bloody well is this is the [freudian] means that is there an attraction?<br/>
<br/>
You know the is there an attraction that's emerging among the female radicals for that<br/>
<br/>
Totalitarian male dominance that they've chased out of the [west]<br/>
<br/>
And I mean that's a hell of a thing to think but I after all I am<br/>
<br/>
[psychoanalytically] [minded] and I do think things like that because like [I] just can see no rational reason for it the only other<br/>
<br/>
Rational reason is that well the west needs to fall and so the enemy of my enemy is our [yeah]<br/>
<br/>
It's a guy exactly now. What is it? I thought that wrong with the enemy of enemy is my friends<br/>
<br/>
Yes, exactly [so] Elements tend to vote liberal as well. Yes<br/>
<br/>
Well, so that that could be the case<br/>
<br/>
but I am not going to shake my suspicions about this unconscious balancing because as the demand for<br/>
<br/>
egalitarianism and the eradication of masculinity<br/>
<br/>
Accelerates there's going to be a longing in the unconscious for the precise opposite for the [problem] of that right the more you want you?<br/>
<br/>
Scream for equality the more your unconscious is going to admire<br/>
<br/>
Dominance and<br/>
<br/>
so<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's that's that's well. That's how you think if your cycle analytically minded<br/>
<br/>
And you know I'm a great admirer of freud<br/>
<br/>
he knew a hell of a lot [more] than people like to think and and so which is partly why everyone still hates him even<br/>
<br/>
Though it's late a hundred years since he's you know really really being around so all right. We should stop<br/>
